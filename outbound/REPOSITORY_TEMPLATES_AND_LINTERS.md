# Repository Templates & Linters

As part of our baseline for repository hygeine, we require certain markdown files and documentation in the project based on their maturity model tier. Below are templates and linters that can used to start new projects or add to existing projects:

Tier 1: https://github.com/DSACMS/repo-scaffolder/tree/main/tier1/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_slug%7D%7D

Tier 2: https://github.com/DSACMS/repo-scaffolder/tree/main/tier2/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_slug%7D%7D

Tier 3: https://github.com/DSACMS/repo-scaffolder/tree/main/tier3/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_slug%7D%7D
