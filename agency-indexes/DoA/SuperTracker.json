    "description": "SuperTracker was an online tool offered by USDA (2011-2018) that helped users track diet, physical activity and weight. SuperTracker provided a personalized plan based on the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans for what you should eat and drink and guided users to making better choices.  This dataset includes the SuperTracker source code (latest update April 2018), including: front end application, database schema, documentation, deployment scripts and a ReadMe.txt file that provides high level instructions for the source code. Database connection strings and actual data are not included. The full foods database spreadsheet is attached as well; these foods are based on the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS), and the Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED), both from the USDA/ARS Food Surveys Research Group.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the code is based on 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and will not be updated to reflect future guidance. In addition, the food database is based on FNDDS from 2011-2012 (FNDDS 6.0) and FPED from 2011-2012 and will not be updated with future data releases.",
