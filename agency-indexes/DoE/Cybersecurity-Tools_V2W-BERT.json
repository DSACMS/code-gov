    "description": "Software Vulnerabilities to Weakness Mapping. V2W-BERT optimizes the learnable parameters \u03b8 of F\u03b8 in two steps. In the first step, the pre-trained BERT language model is further fine-tuned with CVE/CWE descriptions specific to cyber security. In the second step, the trained BERT model is employed in a Siamese network architecture to establish links between CVEs and CWEs. The architecture takes a specific CVE-CWE pair as input and predicts whether the CVE belongs to the CWE or not, with a confidence value. V2W-BERT includes a Mask Language Model (LM) based Reconstruction Decoder to ensure that the descriptions\u2019 contexts are not changed too much during the training process.",
