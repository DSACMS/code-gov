    "description": "Here, we develop MIJAMP (MIJAMP Is Just A MethylBED Parser), a software package that was developed to discover methylated motifs from the output of ONT\u2019s Modkit or other data in the methylBED format. MIJAMP employs a human-driven refinement strategy that empirically validates all motifs against genome-wide methylation data, thus eliminating false, under-, or overexplained motifs. MIJAMP can also report methylation data on a specific, user-defined motif.",
