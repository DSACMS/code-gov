    "description": "This software tool implements a version of the N-SCRAD anomaly detection algorithm. This algorithm classifies a gamma-ray energy spectrum as either consistent or inconsistent with previously measured background and a set of predefined nuisance sources. N-SCRAD was originally developed for DOE/NNSA/NA-22 and has since been utilized in a variety of applications for various clients. The present software tool is intended to demonstrate the capabilities of N-SCRAD. The tool accepts input data as either text files or GADRAS binary files, and saves the output alarm metric as a text file. A separate parameter file allows advanced users to configure algorithm settings.",
