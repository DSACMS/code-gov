    "description": "Neutron multiplicity analysis is a widely used technique in international safeguards and is most commonly applied to the assay of product and scrap materials in the production of mixed oxide fuel. The typical neutron multiplicity analysis applies only a crude, almost cursory, uncertainty\nanalysis limited to propagation of statistical errors in the derived singles, doubles, and triples count rates through the point source model. An assay result without a properly assigned uncertainty has little value, and an assay result with a significantly understated uncertainty can lead to\nboth unsafe facility operations and an increased misclassification rate for the item of interest. We have developed a complete and robust total measurement uncertainty treatment for multiplicity analysis that incorporates instrumental, environmental and nuclear data error contributions.",
