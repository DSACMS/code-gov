    "description": "Given a list of proteins, finds all cross-linked peptides in the given Ion Mobility MS dataset. This application attempts to find all cross-linked peptides in the given Ion Mobility MS dataset. First, the FASTA file is read in and possible peptides are generated by digesting the protein(s) and assuming 1 max missed cleavage. The possible peptides are searched for in the given features by matching up the monoisotopic mass of the feature to the mass of the peptides. The mass ppm tolerance is an input parameter of the application. All possible cross-links of the unmodified peptides are then calculated and searched for in the Isotopic Peak data. A detailed csv results file is created at the end.",
