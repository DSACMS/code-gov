    "description": "PoliMOR is a scalable, automated, and customizable policy engine framework for multi-tiered parallel file systems. It is composed of single-purpose agents that handle tasks such as gathering file metadata, making policy decisions, and then executing actions based on those policies. These agents are designed to communicate using distributed message queues, allowing the number of individual agents to be scaled up as needed. PoliMOR automates the data management tasks by precluding the need for admin intervention. The agents in PoliMOR can be customized to integrate any utilities/tools that perform tasks like metadata scanning and data placement management.",
