    "description": "ORNL Slicer 2 is a slicing program for additive manufacturing. It takes a solid body mesh object, typically as .STL file, and converts that into machine readable instructions, called g-code, that a 3D printer can use to build the object. The functionality includes loading and positioning an object, slicing it into layers, fitting toolpaths to the layers, and outputting g-code to construct the object. All of this is contained within a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to define all of the settings specific to their machine and process, then preview the resultant g-code before starting the printing process.",
