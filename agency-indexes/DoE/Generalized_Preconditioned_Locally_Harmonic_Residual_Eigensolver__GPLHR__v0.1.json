    "description": "The software contains a MATLAB implementation of the Generalized Preconditioned Locally Harmonic Residual (GPLHR) method for solving standard and generalized non-Hermitian eigenproblems. The method is particularly useful for computing a subset of eigenvalues, and their eigen- or Schur vectors, closest to a given shift. The proposed method is based on block iterations and can take advantage of a preconditioner if it is available. It does not need to perform exact shift-and-invert transformation. Standard and generalized eigenproblems are handled in a unified framework.",
