    "description": "The Fat Crayon Toolkit (FCT) provides python modules for assisting in the design and visualization of\nboreholes and tunnels and their relationship with natural features such as fractures. Distances of closest\napproach among the boreholes can be calculated, along with other key design metrics. Additionally, the shear propensity of natural fractures (either deterministic or stochastic) can be visualized in either 3D (as\nVTK files) or in 2D (stereonets). The example provided demonstrates a test bed developed for the\nEnhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) Collab project. This material is based upon work supported by the\nGeothermal Office of the Department of Energy and the Sanford Underground Research Facility and was\nprepared by LLNL under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",
