    "description": "Draco is an object-oriented component library geared towards numerically intensive, radiation (particle) transport applications built for parallel computing hardware. It consists of semi-independent packages and a robust build system. The packages in Draco provide a set of components that can be used by multiple clients to build transport codes. The build system can also be extracted for use in clients. Software includes smart pointers, Design-by-Contract assertions, unit test framework, wrapped MPI functions, a file parser, unstructured mesh data structures, a random number generator, root finders and an angular quadrature component.",
