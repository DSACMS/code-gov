    "description": "Mesoflow is a continuum scale simulation tool developed specifically for modeling transport and chemistry at the mesoscale. Our solver utilizes Cartesian block-structured adaptive mesh refinement to resolve complex surface morphologies (of catalysts/biomass particles among others) directly obtained from X-ray tomography data. An immersed boundary based formulation enables rapid representation of complex geometries prevalent in most mesoporous interfaces. The solver is developed on top of open-source performance portable library, AMReX, providing parallel execution capabilities on current and upcoming high-performance-computing (HPC) architectures. Our flexible software framework enables integration of complex chemical mechanisms at heterogenous interfaces and time-split algorithms for circumventing highly disparate reaction and flow time-scales. Our current studies indicate a ten-fold performance gain by using graphics-processing-units (GPU) compared to a single processor for representative problem sizes (2 million cell mesh).",
