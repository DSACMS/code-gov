    "description": "Extensible quality control dashboard built around FASTQ assessment. FQC is designed to better group FastQC result data across groups where each group is comprised of FASTQs related to an experiment or sequencing batch. Individual samples are grouped into paired-end sets when available and the dashboard's extensibility allows a user to add plots or tables as desired.",
