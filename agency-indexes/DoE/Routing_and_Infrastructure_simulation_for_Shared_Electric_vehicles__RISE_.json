    "description": "FERIS is an agent-based model that simulates the activity of a fleet of electric taxis in a metropolitan area. Agent activities include serving trips, rebalancing to anticipate future demand, and relocating to charge. The modeling framework allows researchers to study the impact of different routing algorithms, battery range, and charging infrastructure on fleet performance, energy consumption, environmental impact, and cost of service.",
