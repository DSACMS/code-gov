    "description": "The Peptide Hit Results Processor (PHRP) can be used to convert an X!Tandem results file (XML format), MSGF+ .tsv search result file, Sequest Synopsis/First Hits file, or Inspect search result into a series of tab-delimited text files summarizing the results. It will insert modification symbols into the peptide sequences for modified peptides. Parallel files are created containing sequence information, modification details, and protein information. The user can optionally provide a modification definition file that specifies the symbol to use for each modification mass.",
