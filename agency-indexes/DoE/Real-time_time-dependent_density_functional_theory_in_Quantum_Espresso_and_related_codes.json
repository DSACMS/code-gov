    "description": "A set of subroutines that interact with an existing computer program, Quantum Espresso (QE), that takes a set of electronic orbitals from QE and propagates them forward in time in response to a number of perturbations. These perturbations include the motion of ions and a wide spectrum of applied electromagnetic fields (e.g., static magnetic fields, slowly-varying electric fields, x-rays, etc.). From the time evolution of the electronic orbitals comes time-varying values of physical observables like the electronic charge and current densities and atomic forces. These are further post-processed to yield properties of interest like stopping powers, conductivities, and the dynamic structure factor. The electronic orbitals are described in a plane wave basis and the equations of motion are carried out using a unitary or approximately unitary time propagation algorithm. Related work will include subroutines for interfacing this capability, as well as others that already exist within QE, with a fork of QE that is more extensible and modular.SAND2019-12611 M\n\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
