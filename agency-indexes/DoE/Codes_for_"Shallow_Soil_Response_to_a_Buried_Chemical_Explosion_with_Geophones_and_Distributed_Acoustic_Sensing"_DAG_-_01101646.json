    "description": "The codes reproduce the figures of the manuscript entitled \"Shallow Soil Response to a Buried Chemical Explosion with Geophones and Distributed Acoustic Sensing\" submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research - Solid Earth.  Geophone data and Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) data recorded during the Phase II of the The Source Physics Experiment (SPE) along a fiber-optic cable offshore were processed to understand the response of the shallow subsurface to an explosion. This Ground-based Nuclear Detonation Detection (GNDD), Low Yield Nuclear Monitoring (LYNM), and Source Physics Experiment (SPE) research was funded by the National Nuclear Security Administration, Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Research and Development (NNSA DNN R&D).",
