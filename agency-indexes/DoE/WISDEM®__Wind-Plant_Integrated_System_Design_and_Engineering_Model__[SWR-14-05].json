    "description": "The Wind-Plant Integrated System Design and Engineering Model (WISDEM\u00ae) is a set of models for assessing overall wind plant cost of energy (COE). The models use wind turbine and plant cost and energy production as well as financial models to estimate COE and other wind plant system attributes. WISDEM\u00ae is accessed through Python, is built using OpenMDAO, and uses several sub-models that are also implemented within OpenMDAO. These sub-models can be used independently but they are required to use the overall WISDEM\u00ae turbine design capability. Please install all of the pre-requisites prior to installing WISDEM\u00ae by following the directions below. For additional information about the NWTC effort in systems engineering that supports WISDEM\u00ae development, please visit the official NREL systems engineering for wind energy website. https://www.nrel.gov/wind/systems-engineering.html",
