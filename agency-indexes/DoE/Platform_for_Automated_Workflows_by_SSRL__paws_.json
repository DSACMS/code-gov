    "description": "paws stands for the Platform for Automated Workflows by SSRL. It was conceived to serve as a lean and modular workflow manager for image-like data. While there are many Python packages providing for a wide variety of processing tasks, we are often faced with a need to bring several packages together, and then to add some home-built scripts as well, to complete a data processing workflow. paws was designed to make this process easy, by providing interfaces to an ever-growing number of existing packages and providing easy ways for users to add their own operations. Occasionally, we have need of an operation that is not provided by a Python package that we know of. In these rare cases, we have developed original operations within PAWS, but such operations intend to live in a lower-level package as soon as they are mature.",
