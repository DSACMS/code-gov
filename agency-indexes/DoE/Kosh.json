    "description": "Kosh allows codes to store, query, share data via an easy-to-use Python API. Kosh lies on top of Sina and as a result can use any database backend supported by Sina. In adition Kosh aims to make data access and sharing as simple as possible. Via \"loaders\" kosh can open files associated with datasets in a seemless fashion independently of the actual file format. Kosh's loader can also load data in different format, although numpy is the most usual output type. Once loaded data from sources, data can be further processed via \"transformers\"",
