    "description": "Margo provides Argobots-aware bindings to the Mercury RPC library. Margo combines Mercury and Argobots to simplify development of distributed services. Mercury operations are presented as conventional blocking operations, and RPC handlers are presented as sequential threads. This configuration enables high degree of concurrency while hiding the complexity associated with asynchronous communication progress and callback management.",
