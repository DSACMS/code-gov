    "description": "By 2050, there could be as many as 10 million photovoltaic (PV) modules that have reached their end of life. The circular economy (CE) proposes to tackle waste issues by maximizing value retention in the economy but transitioning to a CE implies certain stakeholder behaviors. In this context, we propose an agent-based model (ABM) to account for social factors in CE strategies assessment of end-of-life PV modules. Four different types of agents are represented and five possible end-of-life pathways are modeled. A machine-learning metamodel is used to explore the parameter space of the ABM. Results show that excluding social factors underestimates the effect that lower recycling prices have on material circularity by 100% and highlight the limitation of the reuse strategy as, even in an ideal case, used modules only provide a third of demand in the United States. The ABM could be developed to compute the environmental impacts of end-of-life pathways.",
