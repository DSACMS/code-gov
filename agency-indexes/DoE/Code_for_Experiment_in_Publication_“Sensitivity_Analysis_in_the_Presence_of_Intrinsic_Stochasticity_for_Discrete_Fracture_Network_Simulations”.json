    "description": "Following the Open Research requirements for AGU journals, we must release the code used to perform the experiment described in our recent publication, posted at (https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04722).  This code fits a joint emulator to data from a Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) simulation, performed using the open-source software DFNworks (https://dfnworks.lanl.gov/).  All code to be released implements existing methods; there are no novel algorithms nor any major innovations to existing software.",
