    "description": "Resonance Inspection encompasses a suite of techniques for the purpose of materials characterization and nondestructive evaluation. These techniques utilize the mechanical resonances of the sample(s) to determine and monitor material properties (e.g., elastic moduli, phase changes), sort mechanically defective parts, determine the presence/level of mechanical damage (micro-cracking, delaminations, disbonding, etc.) and monitor mass/density fluctuations to name a few applications. The Resonance Inspection Techniques & Analyses (RITA) system has been developed to facilitate these and other applications in a user friendly and cost effective package.",
