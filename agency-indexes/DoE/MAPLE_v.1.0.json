    "description": "SAND2025-00659O\nMAPLE is a software tool that uses epigenomic data to predict gene expression. MAPLE uses a set of epigenomic modifications to determine the effect on gene expression in a specific subset of species. The algorithm can be trained on additional species and epigenomic modifications, enhancing its predictive capabilities. EAGLE employs a hybrid neural network architecture, featuring a convolutional front-end and a multi-head attention layer, to process pre-processed signal data as input. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
