    "description": "Reproducibility is highly desirable for parallel applications, but as they are run on increasingly large and heterogeneous platforms, reproducibility of numerical results or code behaviors is becoming less and less obtainable. The same code can produce different results or occasional failures such as a crash on different systems or even across different runs on the same hardware. PRUNERS is a research and development project that aims at innovating scalable techniques to aid applications to obtain the reproducibility. Specifically, our strategy is to accomplish this by developing a multilevel analysis and control toolset called the PRUNERS Toolset, which combines static and dynamic analysis techniques to detect, control and eliminate targeted sources of non-determinism, as introduced through parallel programming libraries and APIs.",
