    "description": "Sphynx is a software library for parallel graph partitioning and load balancing. It partitions a set of vertices in a graph such that the vertex parts are balanced, and the edge cut is approximately minimized. The primary use case is to partition a computational graph into smaller tasks that can be assigned to processors (cores) for efficient parallel computing. Sphynx is based on the Trilinos scientific computing toolkit so can run on both multi-CPU and multi-GPU systems.
