    "description": "SAND2024-08987O\nOpenCSP analyzes and improves the performance of optical mirrors that reflect sunlight and concentrate it onto a receiver. The algorithms in this library analyze the flow of light from an original source\u2014such as the sun\u2014reflecting off one or more mirrors, and onto a receiver, optical screen, or camera. OpenCSP also analyzes optical systems using other techniques, such as shape or slope comparison. The software calculates aggregate properties of the optical system, such as its efficiency, manufacturing error, pointing control error, expected performance, and other useful parameters. \n\nOpenCSP also includes high-level tools, such as Open SOFAST, a program that obtains high-resolution measurement of CSP mirrors, full heliostats, and other CSP collectors. OpenCSP supports producing meaningful output data to help CSP designers and field operators improve the performance of their systems. OpenCSP also includes classes and functions that support these calculations, including input utilities, analysis output libraries, geometric constraint analysis for drone flight planning, and more. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
