    "description": "MFDn kernels is a collection of small subroutines designed to capture essential characteristics of the Many-Fermion Dynamics---nuclear (MFDn) application (DOI: 10.1016/j.procs.2010.04.012). It features multiple implementations with different programming models/languages of simplified routines analogous to those found in the full application. The main use is to explore the performance and utility of different programming models, languages and compilers.",
