    "description": "Rapid, efficient production of high-quality, sustainable extreme-scale scientific applications is best accomplished using a rich ecosystem of state-of-the art reusable libraries, tools, lightweight frameworks, and defined software methodologies, developed by a community of scientists who are striving to identify, adapt, and adopt best practices in software engineering. The vision of the xSDK is to provide infrastructure for and interoperability of a collection of related and complementary software elements\u2014developed by diverse, independent teams throughout the high-performance computing (HPC) community\u2014that provide the building blocks, tools, models, processes, and related artifacts for rapid and efficient development of high-quality applications.",
