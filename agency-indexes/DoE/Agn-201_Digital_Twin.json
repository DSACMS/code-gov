    "description": "This is the repository for all code related to the AGN-201 Nuclear Reactor Digital Twin at Idaho State University. The goal of this code repository is to consolidate all pieces required to run the AGN-201 Digital Twin in the [DeepLynx](https://github.com/idaholab/Deep-Lynx) ecosystem. This is the first successfully launched digital twin of a fissile nuclear reactor that we are aware of. While the code is not complex, the problems of networking, policy, and initial groundwork were significant to overcome.",
