    "description": "SF-23-067\nBoxKit is a library that provides building blocks to parallelize and scale data science, high performance computing, and\nmachine learning applications for block-structured datasets. Spatial data from simulations and experiments can be\naccessed and managed using tools available in this library when working with more data analysis oriented packages like\nSciKit (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) and FlowNet (https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch)",
