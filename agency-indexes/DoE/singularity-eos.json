    "description": "singularity-eos is a library that provides a unified interface and performance portable implementations of equations of state (EOS).  The library includes a set of simple analytic models that are all published in the open literature and generic tabulated EOS capabilities that build on a generic table interpolation library that is being released under a separate disclosure.  However, absolutely no tabulated data for material EOS is included in singularity-eos.  Instead, users of singularity-eos need to provide the tabulated data.",
