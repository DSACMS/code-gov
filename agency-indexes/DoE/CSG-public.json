    "description": "The Connected and Automated Vehicles Scenario Generation (CSG) model is a system dynamics model. It was built by NREL and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy under the Systems and Modeling for Accelerated Research in Transportation (SMART) Mobility initiative. The purpose of the model is to simulate the \u201ctransitions from predominantly individual ownership of non-CAVs to various future scenarios of high connectivity/automation\u201d(Bush, Vimmerstedt, and Gonder 2019).",
