    "description": "The Compadre Toolkit solves a minimization problem, that once solved allows a user to reconstruct a function from sample data collected from a cloud of data sites. The solution to this minimization can also be used to assemble a linear system that can be solved numerically using some other software. The minimization problem the toolkit solves is to find the optimal finite polynomial in a user specified finite dimensional space with regards to minimizing an objective function which measures a linear sampling functional applied to the polynomial, compared to the same sampling functional applied to the source function, weighted by a positive kernel that has compact support.",
