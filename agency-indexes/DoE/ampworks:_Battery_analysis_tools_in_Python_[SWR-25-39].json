    "description": "Ampworks is a collection of tools designed to process experimental battery data with a focus on model-relevant analyses. It currently provides functions for incremental capacity analysis and GITT data processing, helping extract key properties for life and physics-based models (e.g., SPM and P2D). Some tools, like the incremental capacity analysis module, also include graphical user interfaces for ease of use.\n\nhttps://github.com/NREL/ampworks/\nhttps://pypi.org/project/ampworks/",
