    "description": "Determine uranium and plutonium concentrations of solutions using K-edge densitometry. Returns estimates, including the uncertainty, for the mass densities of U, Pu, Np, Am, Bi, and the matrix. GUI that allows users to select high resolution gamma spectrum files of measurements of vials of solutions containing U/Pu. These spectra are fit to find to find k-edge and x-ray fluorescence peaks. The user can adjust and set fit variables, such as vial size, spectrum parameters, detector specifications, and attenuation coefficients. Technique is an accurate and rapid assay technique commonly used in nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities. The measurement is a typical international safeguards tool for accountancy of U and Pu for dissolved product solutions.",
