    "description": "BRICR is software for translating NREL's BuildingSync\u2122 XML (BSXML) to OpenStudio\u00ae Workflow (OSW) files for simulation.  Each BSXML contains information about a building as well as multiple possible energy efficiency upgrade options.  An OSW file is created and run for each possible efficiency upgrade, the results of all simulations are stored in BSXML format.\n\nBRICR was jointly developed by NREL and LBNL for the San Francisco BayREN: Integrated Commercial Retrofits (BRICR) project funded under the DOE solicitation \"Solutions to Improve the Energy Efficiency of U.S. Small and Medium Commercial Buildings (DE-FOA-0001385)\":\n\nhttps://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/downloads/san-francisco-bayren-integrated-commercial-retrofits",
