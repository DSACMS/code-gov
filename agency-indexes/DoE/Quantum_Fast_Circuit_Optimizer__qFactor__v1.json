    "description": "Quantum programs are represented as circuits, or sequences of gates. A common problem during quantum compilation to find a circuit that implements a target program. This is an optimizer, it optimizes a circuit's distance to the target by solving for the best fit gates. It is not a standard optimizer, it only optimizes circuits. It is not a compiler or synthesizer, it cannot build circuits, but given a circuit structure, it will solve for the gates. Quantum compilers (qsearch, qfast) use standard numerical optimizers. This has advantages over those general-purpose optimizers since it is domain-specific.",
