    "description": "Slepians.jl is a package that solves the concentration problem of Slepian, Landau and Pollak, numerically. Loosely speaking, we find a function that is both finite in extent and has a Fourier transform which lies in a certain domain. In a single dimension, with discrete sampling, the discrete prolate spheroidal sequences solve this optimization problem.",
