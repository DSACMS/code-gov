    "description": "This software implements a one-dimensional model of a supercapacitor and calibrates it to experimental data. A system of coupled partial differential equation models the salt concentration and the ionic and electronic potentials. The term in the equation modeling the capacitance contains a neural network, whose parameters are optimized to fit the provided experimental data. The software is written in python using the open-source library JAX to calculate the gradients needed for the optimization.",
