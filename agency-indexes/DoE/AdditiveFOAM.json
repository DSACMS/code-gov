    "description": "AdditiveFOAM is a continuum heat transfer and fluid flow code for metal additive manufacturing developed on the OpenFOAM CFD Framework. The main components of AdditiveFOAM include: a dynamic heat source model representing heat input from independently moving beams; a robust and efficient thermodynamic solver for solid-liquid phase change in metal alloys; a library to export thermal data to ExaCA\u2014 a cellular automata (CA) code used for predicting solidification grain growth. By integrating these capabilities, AdditiveFOAM offers valuable insights into the process-structure relationships of metal additive manufacturing components.",
