    "description": "The code performs image intensity normalization. A new intensity normalization method is presented, which works well with images whose pixel intensity distribution follow a Gamma Probability Distribution. Some examples are provided to show the normalization effect. This new intensity normalization method is also compared to some other well-established intensity normalization methods.",
