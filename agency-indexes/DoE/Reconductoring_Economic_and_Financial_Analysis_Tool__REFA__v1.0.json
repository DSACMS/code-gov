    "description": "REFA is designed to help transmission planners better understand the financial, environmental and economic benefits of reconductoring upgrades, using traditional or advanced conductors. More specifically, the tool enables grid planners and utilities to demonstrate the entire lifetime value of reconductoring projects, providing potential justifications for projects with higher Capex - the purchase of long-term physical or fixed assets used in a business's operations. Existing tools are designed to compare technical aspects of different conductor applications. They typically do not allow a cost-benefit analysis over the lifetime of the conductor's operations.",
