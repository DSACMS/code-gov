    "description": "SAND2023-07883O\nKokkos software implements C++ performance portability programming models, tools and math libraries, which enables science and engineering software developers to use single-source codes for a wide range of computer architectures. Kokkos also provides implementations of existing and proposed C++ standard features that support programming model and math libraries that are used for implementing performance-portable scientific and engineering applications. The Kokkos libraries provide algorithms, data structures, and tools to enable high-performance computing developers to write performance-portable code. Capabilities fall into three broad categories: Kokkos Core, Kokkos Kernels, and Kokkos Tools.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
