    "description": "Tsuchinoko is a Qt application for adaptive experiment execution and tuning. Live visualizations show details of measurements, and provide feedback on the adaptive engine's decision-making process. The parameters of the adaptive engine can also be tuned live to explore and optimize the search procedure.\n\nWhile Tsuchinoko is designed to allow custom adaptive engines to drive experiments, the gpCAM engine is a featured inclusion. This tool is based on a flexible and powerful Gaussian process regression at the core.\n\nA Tsuchinoko system includes 4 distinct components: the GUI client, an adaptive engine, and execution engine, and a core service. These components are separable to allow flexibility with a variety of distributed designs.",
