    "description": "The State of Stress Assessment Tool (SOSAT) is a set of routines that take in information about a geologic carbon storage reservoir and generates a probability distribution for the state of stress in the reservoir before and during injection. As part of this, the tool reports the estimated probability of a critically-oriented fault becoming activated as a result of the injection. The tool also allows a storage site operator to evaluate the likely value of different types of characterization on the knowledge of the geomechanical conditions and probability of induced seismicity.
