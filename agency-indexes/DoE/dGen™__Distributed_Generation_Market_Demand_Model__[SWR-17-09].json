    "description": "The Distributed Generation Market Demand (dGen\u2122) model is a geospatially rich, bottom-up, market-penetration model that simulates the potential adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs) for residential, commercial, and industrial entities in the continental United States through 2050. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) developed dGen to analyze the key factors that will affect future market demand for distributed solar, wind, storage, and other DER technologies in the United States within a single modeling platform. The dGen model builds on, extends, and provides significant advances over NREL\u2019s SolarDS model (Denholm et al. 2009), which is now deprecated.",
