    "description": "The well-known Fresnel equations solve for the reflection and transmission of light for precise incident angles. The transmission of diffuse radiation incident on a planar or domed surface is often needed for real-world applications. Due to the complexity of the Fresnel equations, the analytical solution of the integration has hitherto been unobtainable over the last centuries. Therefore, this problem was numerically solved by integrating the angular transmittances in space often leading to substantial computing burden and bias in the results. To efficiently estimate the solar energy resource for a glass-covered photovoltaic (PV) module, we derive an analytical solution of diffuse transmission based on the rigorous integration of an alternate form of the Fresnel equations. The approach leads to a simple yet accurate relative transmittance model that reconciles the solar energy sensed by pyranometers and PV panels. With limited and clearly stated approximations, the complex mathematical derivation resulted in an elegant solution.",
