    "description": "DeBoinR (Density Boxplots in R) takes in a set of Probability Density Functions (PDFs), calculates outliers based on several notions of distance, and visualizes these outliers via functional boxplots.  This code is written as a stand-along R package with the hopes of eventually submitting it to CRAN.  The package is written in generality; it would be useful to any researching looking to analyze a general ensemble of PDFs.",
