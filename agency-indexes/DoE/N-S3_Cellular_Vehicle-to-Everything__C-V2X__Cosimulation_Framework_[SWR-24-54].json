    "description": "This is a vehicular networking simulator designed to enable synchronized network simulation with vehicle traffic simulation software. The communications model is based on the 3GPP LTE-V2X Mode 4 protocol, but includes several other wireless network protocol models as well. This simulator includes both a V2X network simulation implemented in ns-3 as well as an interface to automatically configure, run, and interact with a set of ns-3 instances based on network size and available hardware. This software has been tested with Aimsun NEXT 2.0 simulator (with V2X SDK), but uses a generic interface for compatibility with any comparable vehicle traffic simulator across the HELICS co-simulation framework. This software is intended as a generalized extension to vehicle traffic simulation, and does not model any vehicle traffic on its own.",
