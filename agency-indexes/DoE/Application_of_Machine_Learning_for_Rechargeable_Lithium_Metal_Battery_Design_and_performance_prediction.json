    "description": "Rechargeable lithium metal batteries are being intensively studied in recent years because of their high energy density which potentially could double the cell energy of state-of-art Li-ion batteries. However, cell design of realistic high-energy Li metal batteries is quite different with Li-ion batteries, not mentioning prediction of cycle life. A powerful software using machine learning will greatly accelerate academic research and industry battery manufacturing process.",
