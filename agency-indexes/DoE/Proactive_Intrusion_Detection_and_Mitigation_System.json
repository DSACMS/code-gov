    "description": "SAND2023-05661O\nThe proactive intrusion detection and mitigation system (PIDMS) provides grid-edge situational awareness for cybersecurity defense by capturing real-time distributed energy resource (DER) network traffic and performance data with a novel approach that improves the detection and prevention of cyber-physical attacks. \nThe PIDMS addresses the grid-edge security gap with real-time analysis of both network traffic and photovoltaic performance data to deliver a novel, cyber-physical intrusion detection system (IDS) approach that increases the accuracy and effectiveness of detection and mitigation. \nThis hybrid IDS analysis enables dual monitoring that increases the workload of the adversary; both cyber and physical data would have to be simultaneously spoofed to evade detection. Furthermore, monitoring and analyzing cyber data are insufficient in some cases. For example, in an insider threat aimed at disrupting inverter grid-support functions where proper credentials and authentication are achieved, only the altered PV performance would indicate abnormal behavior. All in all, the PIDMS provides novel capabilities for:\n\u2022\tDistributed, real-time cyber-physical detection and mitigation analysis\n\u2022\tCybersecurity defense for grid-edge systems\n\u2022\tAnalysis framework that can provide situational awareness across the transmission, distribution, and DER systems\nThe PIDMS sensor is designed to collect cyber-physical data, process the data using machine-learning algorithms, detect abnormal events, and deploy mitigations. \nWith these goals, the main functional PIDMS objectives are: \n\u2022\tCapability to collect cyber-physical data\n\u2022\tOnboard storage of cyber-physical data\n\u2022\tPeer-to-peer communication\n\u2022\tComputationally efficient machine-learning algorithms\n\u2022\tOnline cyber-physical data analysis\n\u2022\tAlerting/visualization capabilities\n\u2022\tMitigation deployment capability with bump-in-the-wire (BITW) implementation \nEach of these functional objectives enable PIDMS to perform effective cyber-physical intrusion detection and mitigation.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
