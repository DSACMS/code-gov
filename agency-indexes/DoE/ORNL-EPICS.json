    "description": "This collection of applications provides additional capabilities and features to the EPICS toolkit (https://epics-controls.org) for building distributed controls systems and data acquisition systems. They have been developed for a particle accelerator control system and the control and data acquisition systems for neutron scattering and neutron imaging instruments but can be integrated in EPICS-based control systems for other types of machines.",
