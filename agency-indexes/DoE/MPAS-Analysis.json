    "description": "MPAS-Analysis is a software package designed to process and analyze output data of the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) Ocean, Sea-Ice and Land-Ice model components. It is built primarily on the python language, with remapping of model unstructured-grid fields onto regular grids performed through the ESMF package, and with the computation of climatologies performed through the NCO package. The main purpose of MPAS-Analysis is to analyze the MPAS simulations in terms of ocean and ice metrics, in comparison with available observations, and therefore provide an accurate model evaluation and simulation assessment.",
