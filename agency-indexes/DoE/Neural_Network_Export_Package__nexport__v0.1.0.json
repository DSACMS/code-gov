    "description": "nexport is a lightweight python 3 package which enables neural network developers to export the weights and biases of trained networks to useful file types. It provides I/O support for applications which require specific data types for instantiating neural networks in various inference environments. It was initially developed to support exporting to the data structure used by 'inference-engine', a Fortran inference package.",
