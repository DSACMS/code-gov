    "description": "The Retrocommissioning Sensor Suitcase is targeted for use in small commercial buildings of less than 50,000 square feet of floor space that regularly receive basic services such as maintenance and repair, but don't have in-house energy management staff or buildings experts. The Suitcase is designed to be easy-to-use by building maintenance staff, or other professionals such as telecom and alarm technicians. The software in the hand-held is designed to guide the staff to input the building and system information, deploy the sensors in proper location, configure the sensor hardware, and start the data collection.",
