    "description": "The DMS Update Manager is used to keep automated processing manager software up-to-date. Although it is part of PRISM (the Proteomics Research Information and Management System), it is a standalone program and does not contact any databases. The program compares the files on a central distribution share to files on the local computer, updating any files that are out of date. It supports rolling back local files to an older version and auto-deleting extra files.",
