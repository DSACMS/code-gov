    "description": "The Many-Body Adaptive Configuration Interaction Suite (MACIS) is a modern C++ software infrastructure for the development of selected-configuration interaction (sCI) methods for the fermionic many-body problem in quantum chemistry and materials science. MACIS provides a high-performance, parallel implementation of the Adaptive Sampling Configuration Interaction (ASCI) method as related solvers such as self-consistent orbital optimization and the evaluation of excited states and spectral functions. Unlike existing sCI software, MACIS is developed as a modular software infrastructure which allows it to exist both as a standalone sCI solver and as a library to integrate into existing many-body codes. This modularity allows MACIS to be quickly extensible, including its integration with other sCI methods and high-performance solvers.",
