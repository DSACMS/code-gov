    "description": "Socorro can be used to compute the ground-state electron density for a periodically repeated simulation cell in which the external potential is obtained from norm-conserving pseudopotentials or projector-augmented-wave functions. The ground-state electron density is computed by summation over one-electron orbitals which are obtained using the Kohn-Sham formulation of density-functional theory and which are expanded in a plane-wave basis. Various quantities can be computed from the ground-state solution, including atomic forces which can be used to optimize atom positions in the simulation cell and to perform molecular dynamics simulations.",
