    "description": "The Delaunay density diagnostic helps detect and assess geometric scales within unstructured numerical data sets. The algorithm was first introduced in the paper \"Data-driven geometric scale detection via Delaunay interpolation\" by Andrew Gillette and Eugene Kur, 2022. More details can be found in that paper, as well as the included README file.",
