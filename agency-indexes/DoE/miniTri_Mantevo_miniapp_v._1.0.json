    "description": "miniTri is a miniapplication developed as part of the Mantevo project. Given a graph, miniTri enumerates all triangles in this graph and computes a metric for each triangle based on the triangle edge and vertex degree. The output of miniTri is a summary of this metric. miniTri mimics the computational requirements of an important set of data science applications. Several approaches to this problem are included in the miniTri software.",
