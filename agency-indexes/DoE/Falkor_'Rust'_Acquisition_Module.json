    "description": "The acquisition of analog signal from a time of flight mass spectrometer requires robust, efficient, and fast software. Writing multi-threaded applications is inherently more challenging due to the potential for livelocks, deadlocks, and race conditions. Rust was identified as a \"safe\" language that has a compiler that statically checks the code for these potential problems and prevents compilation entirely if detected. Rust is a systems level language, on par with C / C++. However, it supports a thriving package management system similar to npm or NuGet and has other modern features which make it accessible for rapid prototyping and simplifies compilation procedures.",
