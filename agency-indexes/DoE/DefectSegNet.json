    "description": "DefectSegNet for semantic segmentation of defects in Steels\nThe first and most important step of automating defect analysis is perceptual defect identification. In terms of digital image processing, semantic segmentation best emulates human recognition of defect features \u2013 it identifies the crystallographic defects and where they are located in a TEM micrograph. We solved this problem by developing DefectSegNet, a novel hybrid CNN algorithm for robust and automated semantic segmentation of three crystallographic defects, including line dislocations, precipitates and voids, that are commonly observed in structural metals and alloys.",
