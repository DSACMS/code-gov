    "description": "XPlacer Machine Learning Guided Data Placement uses machine learning model to assist programmers to select the data placement advises for application running on HPC system with Nvidia GPUs. XPlacer Machine Learning Guided Data Placement consists three components: (1) 4 revised benchmarks from Rodinia benchmarks; (2) compiler script and execution script to generate variants, and collect training data for the machine learning model; (3) the scripts to post-process the collected data and generate the machine leaning model.",
