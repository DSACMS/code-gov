    "description": "Rhizogrid guided molecular root imaging workflow enables investigating root rhizosphere interactions in a near native\nenvironment. Non-invasive root images are captured, and three-dimensional root images are reconstructed using x-ray\ncomputed tomography technique. Root and rhizosphere samples are then harvested and processed for root-rhizosphere\nmetabolite and microbial profiling.",
