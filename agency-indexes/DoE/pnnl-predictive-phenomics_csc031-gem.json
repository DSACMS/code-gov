    "description": "Genome-Scale Metabolic Model of CarbStor Community member Microbacterium (csc031) Continuous Validation with\nMemote\nThese repositories contain the continuous validation environment for an organism-specific genome-scale metabolic model\n(GEM) using Memote. Memote is a software tool that provides a suite of tests to ensure the quality and consistency of\nmetabolic models. By integrating Memote into a continuous integration (CI) workflow, we can automatically validate\nupdates to the GEM, ensuring that model modifications improve or maintain the model's integrity",
