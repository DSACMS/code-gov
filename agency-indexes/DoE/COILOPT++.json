    "description": "COILOPT++ is a code for designing optimal modular and saddle coils for stellarators.  Given a topologically toroidal plasma equilibrium surface with a specified normal magnetic field component, one or more toroidal winding surfaces enclosing the plasma surface, and initial guesses for one or more coil shapes for each winding surface, COILOPT++ employs a variety of local and global optimization algorithms to adjust the coil shapes to best satisfy a specified set of physical and geometric constraints.  Typical coil representations are cylic cubic B-splines, for which it is possible to specify that a segment of modular coil about the outboard midplane be completely vertical to improve device accessibility.",
