    "description": "We introduce the Binned Large Interval Network Kernel approach for scoring fragmentation mass spectra similarity which takes advantage of sparse matrix multiplication. This enables BLINK to perform 100 million comparisons while maintaining 98% accuracy in 2.2 seconds making it over 1,000 times faster than the current implementations.",
