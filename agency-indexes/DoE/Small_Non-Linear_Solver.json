    "description": "SNLS (small non-linear solver) is a C++ library for solving non-linear systems. The emphasis is on small systems on equations for which direct factorization of the Jacobian is appropriate. The systems of equations may be numerically ill-conditioned. Implementation is amenable to GPU usage, with the idea that class instantiate would occur within device functions.",
