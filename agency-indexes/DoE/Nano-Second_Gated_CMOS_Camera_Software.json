    "description": "nsCamera is a driver for nanosecond gated CMOS cameras developed at LLNL and Sandia. It serves as a uniform application interface regardless of the actual combination of camera electronics and sensors used. The software abstracts the hardware to enable a user to write applications without detailed knowledge of the inner workings of each of the boards an sensors they may wish to deploy.",
