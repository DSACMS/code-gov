    "description": "An object store for scientific data. Shock is a platform to support computation, storage, and distribution. Designed from the ground up to be fast, scalable, fault tolerant, federated. Shock is RESTful. Accessible from desktops, HPC systems, exotic hardware, the cloud and your smartphone. Shock is for scientific data. One of the challenges of large volume scientific data is that without often complex metadata it is of little to no value. Shock allows storage and querying of complex metadata. Shock is a data management system. The long term goals of Shock include the ability to annotate, anonymize, convert, filter, perform quality control, and statically subsample at line speed bioinformatics sequence data. Extensible plug-in architecture is in development.",
