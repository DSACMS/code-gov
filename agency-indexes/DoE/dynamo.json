    "description": "The Software is a toolbox for Dynamic Programming and Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) that enables stochastic, multi-period decision optimization for arbitrary \"black box\" models. It\u2019s modular framework is designed to serve as a wrapper for other simulation tools. This enables forward-looking optimization under uncertainty to aid decision making by a variety of stakeholders when facing an increasingly uncertain future. ",
