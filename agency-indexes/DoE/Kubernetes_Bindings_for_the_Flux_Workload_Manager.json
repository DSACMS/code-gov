    "description": "Flux is a framework for writing resource managers as well as a resource manager for HPC systems. It allows for hierarchical nesting and providing a portable interface for job scheduling across systems. The flux-k8s software provides an interface between Flux and Kubernetes so the two frameworks can use each other's functionality. The code is currently licensed under the LGPL-3.0 License, but we request to re-license the code to promote outside collaboration and community adoption.",
