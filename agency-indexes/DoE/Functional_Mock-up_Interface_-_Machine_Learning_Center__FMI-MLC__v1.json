    "description": "The Functional Mock-up Interface - Machine Learning Center is a tool to interface the Python-Tensorflow library with building simulation models, to develop and train machine learning-based controls. In particular, this framework allows the use of reinforcement learning through the standardized Functional Mock-up Interface, an open industry standard for co-simulation. First application was the development of a controller for dynamic fa\u00e7ade and heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.",
