    "description": "The Transition to Wire (TTW) hardware project is a method for connecting solar research samples with fragile interconnects to robust, weatherproof and consistent commercial connectors. The Transition to Wire device is a printed circuit board designed to facilitate the transition from tab ribbon or other unsecured electrical contacts on research samples to either wires or a connector. The four pin connector provides a kelvin (4 wire) connection at the solder pad where the sample connects.",
