    "description": "This is the official implementation of ResSR [1]. ResSR is a computationally efficient MSI-SR method that achieves high-quality reconstructions by using a closed-form spectral decomposition along with a spatial residual correction. ResSR applies singular value decomposition to identify correlations across spectral bands, uses pixel-wise computation to upsample the MSI, and then applies a residual correction process to correct the high-spatial frequency components of the upsampled bands. While ResSR is formulated as the solution to a spatially-coupled optimization problem, we use pixel-wise regularization and derive an approximate closed-form solution, resulting in a pixel-wise algorithm with a dramatic reduction in computation that achieves state-of-the-art reconstructions.\n\n[1] Duba-Sullivan, H., Reid, E.
