    "description": "SAND2025-01223O\n\"Exploring the Transferability of Machine-Learning Models\" is a software tool that trains and tests machine-learning models using simulated data. It includes Python scripts and a Jupyter Notebook to train models to predict material properties from X-ray diffraction profiles. The software provides a template for developing predictive models without requiring proprietary data. It streamlines the model training process and validates model transferability across different datasets. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
