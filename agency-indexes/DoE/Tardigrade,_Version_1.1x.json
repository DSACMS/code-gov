    "description": "Tardigrade is a collection of functions, libraries, and stand-alone code which enables the simulation of materials using the higher-order micromorphic framework. The tools present are the interface to INL's MOOSE code which is used as the underlying FEA solver, several constitutive equations (linear elasticity, a pressure-sensitive elasto-plastic model, crystal plasticity, and additional models for geo-materials) useful for demonstration purposes and the simulation of some materials, the micromorphic filter which converts DNS information to micromorphic stress-deformation quantities, and the overlap coupling framework which enables multi-scale simulations of a coupled higher-order macroscale and a classically defined microscale.",
