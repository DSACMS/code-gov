    "description": "Official code for the NeurIPS 2023 paper \"Neural Image Compression: Generalization, Robustness, and\nSpectral Biases\". This code can be used to:\n- Computing spectral distortion errors of images compressed with traditional codes or neural image\ncompression models (as proposed in the aformentioned paper)\n- Visualize power spectral densities and fourier heatmaps (as proposed in the aformentioned paper)\n- Train and test a variety of neural image compression models",
