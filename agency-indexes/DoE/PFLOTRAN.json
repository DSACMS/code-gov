    "description": "PFLOTRAN is a GNU LGPL licensed code that simulates single phase water and multiphase (air, co2, water) flow, energy transport, geochemical reaction and biological reaction in the earth's subsurface environment. The problem may be discretized on structured and unstructured grids. The code is designed to run in parallel on supercomputers and leverages the open source PETSc library for solvers and data structures and open source HDF5 for binary file I/O. See www.pflotran.org and/or doc-dev.pflotran.org for further information.
