    "description": "DEBS advances the resistive MHD equations via a combination of the explicit leapfrop method and the semi-implicit method.  In this way the time step is limited by the CFL condition v*kmax*dt < 1, where v is the local flow velocity, NOT the wave propagation (sound plus Alfven) velocity.  The code is thus able to take timesteps that are much larger than allowed by purely explicit codes. For the spatial discretization, DEBS uses a finite difference approximation for the radial variation and a Fourier representation for the variation of the fields in the poloidal and axial directions, i.e it assumes a doubly-periodic geometry. It advances the vector potential in lieu of the magnetic field and uses the Weyl gauge which assumes the electrostatic potential is zero",
