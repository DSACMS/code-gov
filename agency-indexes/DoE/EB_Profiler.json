    "description": "EB_Profiler, v2.2 is a LabVIEW program which uses computed tomography to determine the power\ndistribution in the beams of electron beam welders. It requires that the National Instruments LabVIEW\nRun-Time Engine be installed. The program takes in beam profile data from a data acquisition device or\nfrom a data file. Beam parameters necessary for calculations are entered by the user or automatically\nextracted from header information in the data file. The result is a two-dimensional reconstruction of the\npower distribution in the beam.",
