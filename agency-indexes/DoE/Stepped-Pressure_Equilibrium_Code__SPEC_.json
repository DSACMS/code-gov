    "description": "Building on the theoretical foundations of Bruno & Laurence, that three-dimensional, (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria with \u201cstepped\u201d-pressure profiles are well-defined and guaranteed to exist, whereas 3D equilibria with integrable magnetic-fields and smooth pressure (or with non-integrable fields and continuous-but-fractal pressure) are pathological. Dr. S.R. Hudson wrote the \u201cStepped Pressure Equilibrium Code\u201d, (SPEC). SPEC finds minimal-plasma-energy states, subject to the constraints of conserved helicity and fluxes in a collection of nested sub-volumes by extremizing the multi-region, relaxed-MHD (MRxMHD), energy functional, introduced by Dr. M.J. Hole, Dr. S.R. Hudson & Prof. R.L. Dewar.",
