    "description": "DiscoFluxM is software for modeling the deformation behavior of crystalline materials within the third-party finite-element based software, MOOSE. The software enables full-field crystal plasticity finite element simulations of deformation processes of metals and other crystalline materials. DiscoFluxM is an implementation of the DiscoFlux theoretical and algorithmic framework for coupling single-crystal plasticity with dislocation transport. The \ncontinuum mesoscale modeling framework is founded upon a nonlocal dislocation-density based crystal plasticity theory. The nonlocal theory couples continuum dislocation transport with an otherwise spatially-local single-crystal model employing nonlinear thermoelasticity and crystallographic plasticity. Dislocation transport is modeled by enforcing dislocation conservation at a slip-system level through the solution of advection-diffusion equations. The configuration of geometrically necessary dislocation density gives rise to a back-stress that inhibits or accentuates the flow of dislocations.",
