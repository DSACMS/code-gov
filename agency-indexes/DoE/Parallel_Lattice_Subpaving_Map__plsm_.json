    "description": "Custom spatial subdivision of N-dimensional lattice region in GPU memory. An extension of the method of a hyper-octree is used to allow for arbitrary subdivision ratios in each dimension. In addition, the decision to refine (or select) a given sub-region is based on a user-provided callback, allowing for arbitrary refinement domains to be expressed either geometrically or programmatically.",
