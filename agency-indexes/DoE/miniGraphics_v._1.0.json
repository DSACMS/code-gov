    "description": "The miniGraphics package provides a collection of reference implementations for parallel rendering. In particular, miniGraphics is focused on sort-last parallel rendering, which is the rendering algorithm of choice for HPC rendering. The miniGraphics package provides a collection of simple serial rendering systems and a collection of parallel image compositing methods, which can be combined to test the behavior of parallel rendering under different conditions.",
