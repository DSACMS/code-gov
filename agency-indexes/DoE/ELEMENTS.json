    "description": "ELEMENTS is a C++ library of mathematical functions and computer routines to support a broad range of numerical methods on diverse element types including: a) serendipity linear, quadratic, and cubic elements; b) arbitrary order tensor-product space elements b) high-order spectral elements; and d) a linear space-time element. The ELEMENTS library can be used for research and development of both continuous and discontinuous finite element methods for solving a diverse range of partial differential equations. The library has functions for calculating quantities that are commonly used in continuous and discontinuous finite element methods such as the gradient of a basis function, the Jacobi matrix, the inverse Jacobi matrix, the determinant of the Jacobi matrix, and a physical position inside the element, to name a few examples.  The library supports both Gauss\u2013Legendre and Gauss\u2013Lobatto quadrature rules up to 8 quadrature points in each coordinate direction.  The library has a mesh class designed for unstructured meshes and supports sub-cell decomposition that is used with advanced discontinuous numerical methods.  Novel routines exist in the mesh class for connectivity across various mesh entities including: nodes, vertices, quadrature points, surfaces, elements, subcells, subcell-corners, and subcell-faces.  These routines have simple interfaces and are cleverly designed for computational performance.  The mesh class is designed to minimize memory usage.",
