    "description": "The CORRLA-RS package provides a suite of statistical methods for sampling multidimensional distributions and to conduct sensitivity and correlation analysis of large scale data in the Rust programming language.  The software provides a unique solution to multidimensional constrained sampling problems utilizing a combination of parallelized Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and traditional rejection sampling.  The sensitivity and correlation analysis methods are backed by a high performance randomized singular value decomposition implementation  which enables datasets larger than the random access memory (RAM) size to be analyzed.   Additionally, CORRLA-RS implements the active subspace identification method using a KD-Tree and the randomized singular value decomposition acting in concert.",
