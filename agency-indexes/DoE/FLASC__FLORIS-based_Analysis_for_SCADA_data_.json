    "description": "FLASC provides a rich suite of analysis tools for SCADA data filtering & analysis, wind farm model validation, field experiment design, and field experiment monitoring. The repository is centrally built around NRELs in-house floris wind farm model, available at https://github.com/nrel/floris. FLASC also largely relies on the energy ratio to, among others, quantify wake losses in synthetic and historical data, to perform turbine northing calibrations, and for model parameter estimation.",
