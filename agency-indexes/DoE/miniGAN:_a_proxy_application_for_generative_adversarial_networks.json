    "description": "miniGAN is a python-based machine learning proxy application for generative adversarial networks, developed through the Exascale Computing Project's (ECP) ExaLearn project. It will be included in the main ECP proxy application and the machine learning proxy application suite. It is a proxy for ECP cosmological(CosmoFlow, ExaGAN) and wind energy(ExaWind) applications. miniGAN will be distributed to ECP hardware vendors as part of hardware codesign. miniGAN uses the Numpy/PyTorch/TensorFlow/Keras/Horovod frameworks and libraries. It also relies on the Kokkos and Kokkos-Kernels packages developed here at Sandia Labs.
