    "description": "Rossi Alpha View (RAV) is a teaching aid for explaining what a Rossi-alpha distribution is and how it is generated. The software provides graphical user interface (GUI) in which a pulse train is shown from which a Rossi-alpha distribution is generated as pulses appear. The source strength, correlated fraction, and speed of the pulse train can be adjusted as well as the die-away time and efficiency of the hypothetical detector from which the pulses would be generated. Additionally, neutron coincidence counting principles are illustrated through the software by showing a reals plus accidentals (R+A) gate and an accidentals (A) gate with an adjustable pre-delay, gate width, and long delay.",
