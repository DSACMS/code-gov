    "description": "Tensors (also known as multidimensional arrays or N-way arrays) are used in a variety of applications ranging from chemometrics to network analysis. The Tensor Toolbox provides classes for manipulating dense, sparse, and structured tensors using MATLAB's object-oriented features. It also provides algorithms for tensor decomposition and factorization, algorithms for computing tensor eigenvalues, and methods for visualization of results.",
