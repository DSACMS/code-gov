    "description": "MATBOX is a MATLAB application for performing various microstructure-related tasks including microstructure numerical generation, image filtering and microstructure segmentation, microstructure characterization, result three-dimensional visualization and result correlation, and microstructure meshing. MATBOX was originally developed to analyze electrode microstructures for lithium ion batteries; however, the algorithms provided by the toolbox are widely applicable to other heterogeneous materials. The toolbox provides a user-friendly experience thanks to a Graphic-User Interface.",
