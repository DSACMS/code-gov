    "description": "This project is intended to take a graph and build a smaller (upscaled) graph that is representative of the original in some way. We represent the graph Laplacian in a mixed form, solve some local eigenvalue problems to uncover near-nullspace modes, and use those modes as coarse degrees of freedom.",
