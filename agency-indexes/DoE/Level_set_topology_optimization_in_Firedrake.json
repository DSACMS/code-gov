    "description": "Lestofire is an academic software for the automated design of engineering components. It finds the optimal geometry of a system to minimize a given cost function while constrained by a given set of physics equations. Using a level set function to describe the geometry, lestofire uses shapes derivative to evolve the system until its optimal shape. It leverages the compilation of variational forms in Firedrake (https://www.firedrakeproject.org/) and the automated calculation of shape derivatives via pyadjoint (http://www.dolfin-adjoint.or/en/latest/) to allow fast prototyping of different physics, cost functions and design parametrizations.",
