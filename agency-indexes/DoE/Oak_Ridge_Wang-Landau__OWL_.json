    "description": "The code is a set of first-principles based thermodynamic properties calculations for materials properties at finite temperature. It provides a collection of commonly used Monte Carlo algorithms, interfaced with a few external codes that carry out density functional theory calculations, such as Quantum Espresso and Local Self-consistent Multiple Scattering. The code provides high accuracy thermodynamic calculations that are comparable to real-world materials properties.",
