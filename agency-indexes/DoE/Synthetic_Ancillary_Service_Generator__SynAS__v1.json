    "description": "The balance of demand and supply in the electric power grid is a crucial element to grid reliability. While balancing is typically provided by conventional power plants, with spinning generators, distributed energy resources (DER) and especially electric vehicles (EVs) pose a great potential to provide such service. This project conducted a field demonstration at the Los Angeles Air Force Base (LA-AFB) where a fleet of mixed-use bi-directional EVs were actively participating in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) market for frequency regulation. While participation in regulation markets is promising, a major drawback in designing control systems and assessing potential revenue is the lack of example frequency regulation signals. This project introduces an open-source dataset for 143 days of four-second regulation data, and the SynAS Python module to synthetically generate frequency regulation signals of arbitrary length.",
