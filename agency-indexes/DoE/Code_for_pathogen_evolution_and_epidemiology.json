    "description": "These codes and scripts will perform analyses related to genetic, evolutionary and epidemiological investigations of pathogen spread. The codes and scripts manipulate data from HIV and other pathogens and their hosts, with the goal to perform scientific investigations on how such pathogens spread, evolve, and cause disease. These codes and scripts are typically developed for specific analyses, performed by specialized scientists. It is often required by journals to make such codes available upon publication, so other scientists can check results and adapt the codes for their own research. Our research under which these codes are developed is supported by the NIH, which requires us to share codes with other researchers.",
