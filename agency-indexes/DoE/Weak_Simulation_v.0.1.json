    "description": "The SPARSIFY algorithm implemented by the code allows for classical simulation of universal quantum computer sample outcomes. The code sparsifies the stabilizer decomposition of a qubit t-tensored T gate magic state to some additive error. This is accomplished by either independent L1 sampling or with correlated L1 sampling to supplement an independent subset, which offers a more efficient decomposition: for a given t, a sparser decomposition is sufficient with correlated L1 sampling to satisfy a given additive error.
