    "description": "Overview of the OpenStudio\u00ae Fault Models Gem: Creating a comprehensive library of OpenStudio\u00ae fault models.\nFeatures:\n - Physics-based fault impact simulation within the capability of EnergyPlus\u00ae/OpenStudio\u00ae\n- Fault intensity implementation simulating how severe faults are (e.g., how much portion is fouled in the condenser heat exchanger) and estimating the impact of a fault in different fault intensities. \n- Fault evolution implementation simulating evolving/increasing fault intensity through certain period of time. \nFuture goals:\n- what are common/typical faults in different sample spaces (e.g., HVAC system type, building operation type, building location etc.)? \n- how often (e.g., incidence and prevalence) faults occur in different sample spaces (e.g., HVAC system type, building operation type, building location etc.)?",
