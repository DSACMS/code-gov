    "description": "Low precision-based nearest neighboring particle searching algorithm.This work introduces a computationally efficient Nearest Neighbor Particles Searching (NNPS) algorithm tailored for the\nmeshfree Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method in large-deformation problems simulations. The innovation lies\nin the strategic use of low-precision float-point 16 (FP16) in NNPS for efficiency purpose.",
