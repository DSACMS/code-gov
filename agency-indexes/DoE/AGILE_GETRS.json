    "description": "AGILE GETRS provides an optimized implementation of DETRS that is faster than vendor optimized libraries for small (< 4000) problem sizes. These small problems sizes are of interest to researchers in the Grid Research Integration and Deployment Center (GRID-C) researching real-time power electronics simulations.\n\nIn addition to our implementation of DETRS, this code provides a test using Google Benchmark which generates matrices of various sizes, fills them with random numbers, runs GETRS, verifies the solution is correct and reports average runtime and other performance metrics.",
