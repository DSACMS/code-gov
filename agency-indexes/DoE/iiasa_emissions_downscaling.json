    "description": "This software tool, written in R, performs manipulations necessary to translate Human-Earth system model regional/sector emission outputs, such as those from PNNL's Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), to gridded form needed by Earth System Models, such as DOEs E3SM (Energy Exascale Earth System Model) model. The tool takes as its primary input emissions in a standard community format, and produces CF-compliant netCDF gridded emission as its primary output. As intermediate output the tool produces downscaled emissions at the country level.",
