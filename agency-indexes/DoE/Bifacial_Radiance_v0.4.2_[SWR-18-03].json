    "description": "The bifacial_radiance software contains a series of Python wrapper functions to make working with RADIANCE easier, particularly for the PV researcher interested in bifacial PV performance. For more information, check out our documentation, Tutorials in the form of Jupyter Notebooks, or refer to our Wiki and Issues page.\n\nInstallation\nhttps://youtu.be/4A9GocfHKyM This video shows how to install the bifacial_radiance software and all associated software needed. More info on the Wiki. Instructions are also shown below.\n\nFor detailed instructions of how to install bifacial_radiance, you can also refer to the installation guide.\n\nA GUI has been added in version 3.0. The GUI reads/writes all input parameters necessary to run a simulation, and runs the specified simulation by calling the correct functions with the specified parameters. So no need to use a journal or a script! But you still need to install following the procedure below.",
