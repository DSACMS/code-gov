    "description": "MF-LBM-nanopore is a high-performance lattice Boltzmann code for direct numerical simulation of flow in nano-porous media with confinement effects. The main features of the code include: 1) implemented with adsorption and slip modules that enable simulation of flow in nano-porous media with confinement effects; 2) extensively optimized for modern SIMD/SIMT processors/co-processors, such as GPU; 3) based on MPI-OpenACC/OpenMP hybrid programing model that enables high portability. The main application of the code is in modeling shale gas flow.",
