    "description": "Exodiff compares the results data from two Exodus II files. By defult, a relative difference is used with a tolerance of 1.-6 (about 6 significant digits). The nodal locations are also compared using an absolute difference with a tolerance of 1.e-6. Time step values are compared using a relative difference with a tolerance of 1.e-6 and a floor of 1.e-15. If a third file [diffile.exo] is given, then it is overwritten with the difference of the two files.",
