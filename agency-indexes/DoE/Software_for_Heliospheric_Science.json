    "description": "This software is being developed to support data analysis, modeling, and simulation for the growing field of heliosphere physics. In particular, this software will implement data analysis, modeling, inference, and simulation of physical mechanisms describing how energetic neutral atoms behave within the Earth\u2019s heliosphere and in the interstellar medium beyond.",
