    "description": "Armish-fireplace is a middleware container. It allows asynchronous rx and tx for the client implemented with a multithreaded buffer. It contains modules which organizes module-specific processing units. These processing units are the heart of the processing armish-fireplace does. A processing unit may be a hardware device driver or a hardware simulation driver. Processing units can be loaded/unloaded at runtime changing functionality.\n",
