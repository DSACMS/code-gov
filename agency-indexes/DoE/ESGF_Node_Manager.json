    "description": "The ESGF Node Manager is transitioning.  We are repurposing this repo to contain the material essential for installing the new node manager while keeping the original parts of the previous version. 1) java source needed for access logging filter only - future work is to migrate this to another module within ESGF. 2) python sources: for database table creation, for node manager request and worker daemon and django REST service API 3) bash control scripts\n",
