    "description": "Originally developed in 1999, an updated version 8.8.0 with bug fixes was released on September 30th, 2017. EnergyPlus\u2122 is a whole building energy simulation program that engineers, architects, and researchers use to model both energy consumption\u2014for heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting and plug and process loads\u2014and water use in buildings. EnergyPlus is a console-based program that reads input and writes output to text files. It ships with a number of utilities including IDF-Editor for creating input files using a simple spreadsheet-like interface, EP-Launch for managing input and output files and performing batch simulations, and EP-Compare for graphically comparing the results of two or more simulations. Several comprehensive graphical interfaces for EnergyPlus are also available. DOE does most of its work with EnergyPlus using the OpenStudio\u00ae software development kit and suite of applications. DOE releases major updates to EnergyPlus twice annually.",
