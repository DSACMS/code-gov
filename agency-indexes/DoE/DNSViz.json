    "description": "The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) add authentication to the DNS. However, analyzing and troubleshooting a DNSSEC deployment is difficult in part because of the protocol complexity and in part because authentication involves retrieving dependent components from a number of different Internet locations. DNSViz was written to bring all these DNSSEC components together into a single graph, so they can be represented visually, and nuances can be highlighted for easy identification. DNSViz includes functionality for both analyzing a domain name using active probing and visual representation of the domain name, available currently through a Web interface.",
