    "description": "The Model for Prediction Across Scales-Seaice (MPAS-Seaice) is an unstructured-mesh sea ice model (sea ice is the frozen surface of the sea at high latitudes) capable of using enhanced horizontal resolution in selected regions of the sea-ice domain. The model has the capability to perform high-resolution regional simulations without the need for lateral boundary conditions. MPAS-Seaice solves equations describing both the dynamics and thermodynamics of sea ice. For dynamics, MPAS-Seaice solves a momentum equations describing the balance between air and ocean surface stresses, inertia, Coriolis and sea surface tilt forces, and ice internal stresses, to determine the sea-ice velocity. This velocity is used in a transport scheme to advect mass and tracer variables. In the vertical direction, among other processes, freezing of sea-water and ice and snow melt are determined, as is the internal temperature and salinity of the ice. As external forcing, MPAS-Seaice uses wind and ocean current velocities, air and ocean temperatures and atmospheric radiation fluxes.",
