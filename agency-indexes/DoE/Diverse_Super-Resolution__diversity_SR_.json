    "description": "Deep learning tools for enhancing the spatial resolution of wind data. The software is developed in Python using the TensorFlow deep learning package. Models for diversity super-resolution is provided. Included in the package are pretrained models with example code/data to perform the super-resolution as well as tools of training models for different enhancement- or data-types. The super-resolution is an inherently ill-conditioned problem, with multiple high-resolution fields plausibly mapping to the same coarse field. Considitional GANs provide a framework for generating a distribution of high-resolution realizations from a given low-resolution input. Stochastic estimation is used to inform the network of the expected degree and location of sub-grid diversity. The package includes a pretrained network to generate distributions of 10x-enhanced fields of wind data.",
