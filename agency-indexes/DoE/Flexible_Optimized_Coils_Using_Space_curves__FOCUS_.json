    "description": "FOCUS uses 3D curves to represent coils in fusion devices, mainly for toroidal devices including stellarators and tokamaks. For a given configuration, FOCUS can find optimal coils, which can produced the required magnetic field for confining the plasma meeting the user-specified physics and engineering constraints.",
