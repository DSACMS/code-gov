    "description": "This computer code uses the concept of the parallax to compute the x, y and z coordinates of points found using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), or any transmission imaging technique, using two images, each taken at a different perspective of the region containing the points. Points correspond, but are not limited, to the center of cavities or precipitates, positions of irradiation black dot damage, positions along a dislocation line, or positions along where an interface meets a free surface. Features can include dislocations, interfaces, cavities, precipitates, inclusions etc. The x, y and z coordinates of the points are output in a text file. The code also allows the user to visualize the features containing the points in three dimensions.",
