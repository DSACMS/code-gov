    "description": "The software, called the Urban Deployment Model (UDM), is an integrated set of tools for the simulation and analysis of static and mobile radiation detection systems in complex urban environments. The UDM includes a graphical user interface through which the workflow associated with setting up and executing a simulation may be established. The modular toolsets combine aspects of radiation transport, navigation, graph theory, optimization, and visualization to allow the complete end-to-end simulation of large scale, highly-distributed sensor networks.",
