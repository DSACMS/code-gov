    "description": "LMT is a distributed system that provides a \"top\"-like display of the activity levels of the server-side (MDS, OSSes, and LNET routers) nodes of one or more Lustre-based filesystems.  It is possible to watch server metrics in real time, and to graph past behavior.  The clients provide this capability, but it is also possible to directly mine the MySQL database, e.g. with SQL scripts and GNU plot.\n",
