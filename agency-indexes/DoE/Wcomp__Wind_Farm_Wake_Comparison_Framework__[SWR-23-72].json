    "description": "The Wind Farm Wake Comparison Framework (Wcomp) is a software tool to facilitate the comparison of a specific collection of wind farm wake modeling tools: Python-based, steady-state, analytical wake modeling utilities. Wcomp integrates another software project, windIO, to create a consistent method for describing a wind farm flow control problem. Additionally, a data structure is included to represent the outputs a wind farm flow control simulation. Well-described interfaces allow existing wake modeling tools to plug into this framework.",
