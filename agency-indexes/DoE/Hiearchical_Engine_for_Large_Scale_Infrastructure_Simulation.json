    "description": "HELICS ls a new open-source, cyber-physlcal-energy co-simulation framework for electric power systems. HELICS Is designed to support very-large-scale (100,000+ federates) co\u00adsimulations with off-the-shelf power-system, communication, market, and end-use tools. Other key features Include cross platform operating system support, the integration of both eventdrlven (e.g., packetlzed communication) and time-series (e.g.,power flow) simulations, and the ability to co-Iterate among federates to ensure physical model convergence at each time step.",
