    "description": "bifacialvf is a self-contained view factor (or configuration factor) model which replicates a 5-row PV system of infinite extent perpendicular to the module rows.  Single-axis tracking is supported, and hourly output files based on TMY inputs are saved.  Spatial nonuniformity is reported, with multiple rear-facing irradiances collected on the back of each module row.\n\nBilinear interpolation code add-on to bifacialvf (description below) to pre-generate IV arrays and bifacial coefficients, and to examine the energy production with back side irradiance mismatch for either a portrait or landscape module.\nIncluded are IV curves and bifacial info for a Yingli (standard) module.\n\nBased on the publication: \"A Practical Irradiance Model for Bifacial PV Modules\" B.
