    "description": "Ryujin (https://github.com/conservation-laws/ryujin) is a high-performance finite-element software for solving mathematical partial differential equations (PDEs) with dominant hyperbolic structures. The author of this request, Eric Tovar, is using Ryujin as a high-performance tool for his Mark Kac postdoctoral fellowship research at LANL. Eric would like to contribute openly to the ryujin software without changing its core functionality. This includes: (i) bug fixes; (ii) re-organization of code for performance and syntactic updates including documentation; (iii) implementation of new PDE numerical methods that align with the core solver; (iv) implementation of new initial state configurations for target applications.",
