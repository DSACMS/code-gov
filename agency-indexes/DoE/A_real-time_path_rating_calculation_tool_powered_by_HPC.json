    "description": "If transmission path ratings are determined in real time and optimized control methods can be implemented, congestion problems can be more effectively managed using the existing transmission assets, reducing congestion costs, avoiding capital expenditures for new physical assets, increasing revenues from the existing system, and maintaining reliability. In just one illustrative case, a BPA study has shown that a 1000-MW rating increase for a transmission path generates $15M in annual revenue, even if only 25% of the increased margin can be tapped for just 25% of the year.",
