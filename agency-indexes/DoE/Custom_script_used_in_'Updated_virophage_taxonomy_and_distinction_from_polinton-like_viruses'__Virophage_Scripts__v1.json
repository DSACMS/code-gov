    "description": "This is a script and the associated test input/output that will accompany a new manuscript (soon to be submitted for publication). It can be used to detect and classify virophage, a specific group of viruses. This script is released as documentation for the manuscript, but there is no specific invention, and most bioinformaticians would be able to recreate a comparable script in a matter of days (if not hours) based on the description in the manuscript.",
