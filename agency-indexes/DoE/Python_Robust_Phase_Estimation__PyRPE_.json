    "description": "Robust Phase Estimation (RPE) is a quantum algorithm to determine the relative phases of eigenstates of a unitary operator. This code implements the classical portion of the RPE algorithm, useful both in simulation (e.g., Sandia's pyGSTi or IBM's Qiskit simulators) and on actual quantum hardware (e.g., IBM's Qiskit Quantum Experience). It additionally implements improvements in these dependent software packages, for both required core function of the RPE and improved usability.
