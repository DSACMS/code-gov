    "description": "SAND2025-00927O\nCORRA is a software tool that helps evaluate the costs and benefits of inspecting and repairing wind turbine blades. It combines probabilistic analysis of blade damage with economic analysis to calculate the overall cost of energy production. CORRA can compare different maintenance strategies and their impact on energy costs, which aids in the optimization of wind turbine operations. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
