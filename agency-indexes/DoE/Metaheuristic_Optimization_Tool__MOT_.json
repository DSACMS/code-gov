    "description": "This tool is a suite of optimization algorithms along with a structure that allows users to optimize and process result.\n\nGenerally, the optimization algorithm samples an input set from a user-defined range, runs it through simulation, extracts results (scores) from function, and iterates into an optimized solution.",
