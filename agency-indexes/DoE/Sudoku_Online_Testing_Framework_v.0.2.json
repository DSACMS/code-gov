    "description": "The Sudoku Online Testing Framework provides a configurable basis for testing user interactions to solve visualization-related problems with sudoku puzzles and games. It consists of a server, a client, and test code. The python server implements sudoku puzzle logic and board selection functions. The JavaScript client implements a graphical user interface (GUI) front-end to display the puzzles and facilitate interactions with users. Within the GUI, logical rules may be selected. Cells may be selected to \u201cpivot\u201d on to make a board for each possible value in the cell. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.
