    "description": "SAND2022-12609 O\nPlasMod0 is a 0-dimensional plasma modeling which approximates a plasma as a well-stirred reactor. The model uses two temperatures, one for electrons and one for ions and neutrals. This model was originally developed for laser produced plasma in single-particle aerosol mass spectrometers. As a result, there are some specialized capabilities that include spherical expansion into vacuum at a user-specified rate and photon reactions. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
