    "description": "MELCOR is a severe accident code developed at Sandia National Laboratories for the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  It is an integral code with models describing the important physics that come into play during a severe accident.  Such physics includes, but is not limited to, the heat-up of reactor core components, thermal hydraulics, oxidation of materials, core degradation, release of fission products from components and the transport of those fission products and other important aerosols through a reactor system, molten core/concrete interactions, and modeling of reactor safety systems.  MELCOR modeling is general and flexible, using a \u201ccontrol volume\u201d approach to describe the plant system which has also allowed it to successfully model spent fuel pools.",
