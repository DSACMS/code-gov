    "description": "Boiler tubes in steam power plants experience tube blockages due to exfoliation of oxide grown on the inner side of the tubes. In extreme cases, significant tube blockages can lead to forced power plant outages. It is thus desired to predict through modeling the amount of tube blockage in order to inform power plant operators of possible forced outages. SpalLoop solves for the stress-strain equations in an axisymmetric geometry, tracking the stress/strain evolution during boiler operation including outages for the entire boiler tube length. At each operational outage, i.e., temperature excursions down to room temperature, the amount of exfoliated area for the entire tube loop is estimated the amount of tube blockage is predicted based assumed blockage geometry and site. The SpaLLoop code contains modules developed for oxide growth, stress analysis, tube loop geometry, blockage area by taking into account the following phenomena and features, (a) Plant operation schedule with periodic alternate full-load and partial-load regimes and shut-downs, i.e., temperature excursions from high-load to room temperature, (b) axisymmetric formulation for cylindrical tubes, (c) oxide growth in a temperature gradient with multiple oxide layers, (d) geometry of a boiler tube with a single tube loop or two tube loops, (e) temperature variation along the tube length based on hot gas temperature distribution outside the tube and inlet steam temperature, (f) non-uniform oxide growth along the tube length according to the local steam tube temperature, (g) exfoliated area module: at each operational outage considered, the amount of exfoliated area and exfoliated volume along the tube is estimated, (h) blockage module: at each operational outage considered, the exfoliated volume/mass for each tube loop is estimated from which the amount of tube blockage is predicted based on given blockage geometry (length, location, and geometry). The computer program is written in FORTRAN90. Its modular structure was sought for allowing the best flexibility in updating the program by implementing new constitutive equations due to availability of new material property data and/or new physical phenomena.",
