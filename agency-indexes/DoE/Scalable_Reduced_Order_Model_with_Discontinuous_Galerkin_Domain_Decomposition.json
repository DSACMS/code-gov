    "description": "scaleupROM is a scalable, physics-constrained reduced order model (ROM). It aims to provide robust,\naccelerated physics predictions at extrapolated scales, based on the small, component-level data. This is\nimplemented by combining projection-based ROM with discontinuous Galerkin domain decomposition, in\nthe framework of MFEM and libROM. It currently supports the Poisson equation and Stokes flow\nequation, and more work is in progress toward general, nonlinear physics systems.",
