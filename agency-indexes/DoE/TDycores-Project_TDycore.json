    "description": "The terrestrial dycores will solve tightly coupled conservation of water and energy equations. While the land dycore will simulate processes for a three-dimensional subsurface coupled to a one-dimensional plant\u2019s vascular system, the river dycore will simulate two-dimensional processes in the river.",
