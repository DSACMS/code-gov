    "description": "Floorspace.js is a 2D geometry editor. Users can define an explicit floor plan for each story of a building. A story-by-story interface makes it easy to develop space geometry and assign properties. Referencing satellite imagery or floor plan images, when available, speeds up geometry entry. Conversion of 2D to 3D geometry is currently out of scope for Floorspace.js, a reference implementation is available in the OpenStudio\u00ae SDK. Explicit floor plans allow more building-specific information than parameterized shoe-boxes but less information than a full 3D BIM model. Sloped walls, complex roofs, detailed shading structures, and other complex 3D structures are out of FloorspaceJS's scope. In general, if users have a 3D BIM model in a tool that can export a useful BEM representation then it is better to use that export than to recreate a new model using FloorspaceJS. Re-usability and minimal dependencies were key design considerations for software developers. Web technologies can be used in both online and desktop applications. The editor was written in pure JavaScript for maximum portability and re-usability. A custom JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file format was developed to ease integration with other applications. Custom JSON schema design was a key part of FloorspaceJS development.",
