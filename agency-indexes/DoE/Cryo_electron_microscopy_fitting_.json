    "description": "The tool inputs cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) 3-D reconstructions and an accompanying 3-D atomistic model of a molecular complex. It uses molecular simulation to guide the atomistic model into the 3-D reconstruction, making the atomistic model more consistent with the 3-D reconstruction. This will not be distributed by LANL. This was designed with the intention of being open to the public.",
