    "description": "Representation learning is a deep-learning based technique for extracting features from data for the purpose of machine learning. This requires a large amount of data, on order tens of thousands to millions of samples, to properly teach the deep neural network. This a system for continuous representation learning, where the system may be improved with a small number of additional samples (order 10-100). The unique characteristics of this invention include a human-computer feedback component, where assess the quality of the current representation and then provides a better representation to the system. The system then mixes the new data with old training examples to avoid overfitting and improve overall performance of the system. The model can be exported and shared with other users, and it may be applied to additional images the system hasn't seen before.",
