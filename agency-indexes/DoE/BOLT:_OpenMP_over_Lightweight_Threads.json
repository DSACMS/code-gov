    "description": "BOLT targets a high-performing OpenMP implementation, especially specialized for fine-grain parallelism. BOLT utilizes a lightweight threading model for its underlying threading mechanism. It currently adopts Argobots, a new holistic, low-level threading and tasking runtime, in order to overcome shortcomings of conventional OS-level threads. The current BOLT implementation is based on the OpenMP runtime in LLVM, and thus it can be used with LLVM/Clang, Intel OpenMP compiler, and GCC. More information about BOLT can be found at http://www.bolt-omp.org.",
