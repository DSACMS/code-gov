    "description": "This collection of python scripts is the co-optimizer, or the co-optima scenario analysis tool. This release (V0.2) is intended primarily to analysis such as done to support co-optima project planning and identification of potentially fruitful research directions rather than specify particular fuel blends. The intention of this release is to add concreteness to the co-optimization concepts, and facilitate discussion between the teams and stakeholders as the tool evolves. The user interface is currently non-existant from a productions standpoint. Questions, comments, and rants can be directed to Ray.Grout@nrel.gov",
