    "description": "A digital twin for synchrotron-based tomography for generating synthetic datasets from ground-truth phantoms. The code outputs greyscale projection images / tomographic volumes with realistic artifacts such as noise and phase-contrast and emulates their dependence on the acquisition parameters defining the beam and detector configuration. Some ground-truth phantoms are included with the code.",
