    "description": "UnitTesterSG is a unit testing framework that is designed for nested and/or scientific/engineering data structures. It is designed primarily for testing the outputs if a single function or simulation run by storing the expected results file such that comparisons to the stored output can be made with unit tests after the function or software has been edited.\n\nThis module is designed to be able to unit test arrays, strings, as well as nested and deeply nested objects (including arrays with tuples inside, arrays with strings inside, etc.). The module is compatable with nested objects, and thus has a dependency on the nestedObjectsFunctions module within. The module takes *calculated* results and then compares them to *expected* results. If no expected results are available (or they do not match the calculated results) the module then offers to store the calculated results as expected results for next time.",
