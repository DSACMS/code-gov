    "description": "Background: Codon2Vec is an embedding neural network that predicts 'high' or 'low' gene expression directly from the protein-coding sequences. Embedding neural networks are commonly used for natural language processing (NLP) applications. Analogous to how an English sentence is a string of words, a gene can be thought of as a string of codons. Similar to how NLP neural networks model English sentences as a non-random sequence of words, we considered a coding sequence as a non-random non-overlapping array of codons (k-mers of length = 3). Value Proposition: - Codon2Vec achieved a high median AUC-ROC score of 83.8% when trained and applied to transcriptomic data from 300 fungal species - Unlike Codo2Vec, conventional methods predicting for expression based on codon usage rely on a priori knowledge of optimal codons or a set of reference genes. - Unlike Codon2vec, these methods do not account for the effect of codon order on gene expression. - Codon2Vec neural network bypasses the need for artisanal feature selection step that is necessary for traditional machine learning models.",
