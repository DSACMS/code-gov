    "description": "The Archive Sprinter tool is designed to efficiently process synchrophasor measurements from electric power grids and\nexport data signatures that summarize the grid's behavior. Parallel processing will allow data to be processed quickly to\nenable practical analyses of archives spanning years. The grid's behavior will be summarized using a wide-array of\nsignatures calculated from the input data.",
