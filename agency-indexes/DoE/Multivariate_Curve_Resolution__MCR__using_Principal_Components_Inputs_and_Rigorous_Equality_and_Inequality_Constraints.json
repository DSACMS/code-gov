    "description": "This MATLAB pseudocode perform multivariate curve resolution (MCR) using PCA scores & loadings of data  as inputs. It employs rigorous least squares equality and inequality constraints for all elements in the solution factor matrices. It also can be used to perform nonnegative matrix factorization.\nSAND2020-12650 M\n\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
