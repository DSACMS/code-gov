    "description": "A web app for searching the data broker. This is a proof-of-concept of the idea that metadatastore will empower scientists to \"Google their data.\" In this demo implementation, the results come back as a truncated list of uids, each with a convenience \"Copy to clipboard\" button. The HTML of each result is pluggable and can be customized on a result-by-result basis.",
