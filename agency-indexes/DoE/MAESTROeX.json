    "description": "MAESTROeX is a massively parallel, finite-volume C++/F90 solver for low Mach number astrophysical flows. The code utilizes a low Mach number equation set allowing for more efficient, long-time integration of highly subsonic flows compared to compressible approaches. The recommended range of applicability is for flows where the Mach number does not exceed~0.1.",
