    "description": "The Stream-Processing Architecture for Real-time Cyber-physical Security is a generalized framework for extracting power-related sensor information from sensors, optionally analyzing that data on computing platforms local to the sensors, transmitting that information to a central location, storing that information, running centralized analytics on the information, and providing both API and visual access to that information.",
