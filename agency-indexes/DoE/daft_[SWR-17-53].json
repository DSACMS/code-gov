    "description": "Daft is a Haskell library that implements the key constructs of relational algebra via static structural typing.  Its DataCube typeclass supports selection, projection, aggregation, disaggregation, natural joins, semijoins, and antijoins.  Instances of DataCube include both map- and function-based representations.  An additional abstract data type provides Vinyl-style, keyed relational tables for which an embedded domain-specific language compactly represents relational operations.  Utility types and functions support serialization to tab-separated-value data files, JSON arrays, MongoDB documents, and PostgreSQL tables, including automatic detection and verification of the schema for the input data.",
