    "description": "MHYSA is a conservative finite-difference code to solve the 1D, 2D, and 3D multispecies Navier-Stokes equations for hypersonic flow applications. \n\nIt supports Cartesian grids only and has the option of including immersed boundaries.\n- Solves 1D Euler and 2D and 3D Navier-Stokes equations.\n- Solves the PDEs over Cartesian grids.\n- Written entirely in C and uses the MPICH library. It also uses OpenMP threads but this is a work-inprogress.\n- Can be compiled with PETSc (http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/), if available, where it can use PETSc's time integration module TS (http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-current/src/ts/).\n- For 3-dimensional simulations, the immersed boundaries can be used to solve over non-Cartesian geometries.\n\nMHYSA has been developed to be scalable, and apart from the usual functionalities to solve a system of PDEs on distributed architectures, it provides scalable file I/O functions.\n",
