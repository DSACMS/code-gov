    "description": "UQ4ML is a code repository for a set of tools for the development of robust machine learning methods, uncertainty quantification and explainability of machine learning methods. The goal of these tools is to develop more robust and statistically rigorous machine learning methods for scientific applications. These tools are developed in Python, a high-level programming language that takes advantage of the Python ecosystem of high-quality open-source packages for machine learning.",
