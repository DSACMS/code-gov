    "description": "LIME 0.5 is an initial version of a Lightweight Integrating Multi-physics Environment for coupling codes. LIME by itself is not a code for doing multiphysics simulations. Instead, LIME provides the key high-level software, a flexible but defined approach, and interface requirements for a collection of (potentially disparate) physics codes to be combined with strong coupling (when needed) though non-linear solution methods (e.g. JFNK, fixed point), thus creating a new multi-physics simulation capability customized for a particular need. The approach taken is designed to; preserve and leverage any important specialized algorithms and/or functionality an existing application may provide; minimize the requirements barrier for an application to participate; and work within advanced solver frameworks (e.g. as extensions to the Trilinos/NOX nonlinear solver libraries, PETSc, . . .). Of note is that components/physics codes that can be coupled within LIME are NOT limited to: components written in one particular language; a particular numerical discretization approach ( e.g. Finite Element); or physical models expressed as PDE's.",
