    "description": "CACTUS is a code that calculates the performance and aero/hydrodynamic loads of a wind or water turbine. The turbine may be either a vertical-axis or a horizontal-axis machine, and may consist of one or more blade curved or straight blades. The performance model is based on a lifting-line free wake formulation that calculates rotor power and blade loads in the time domain. The rotor is treated as a rotating rigid body, such that structural dynamical motions are not modeled. The turbine is assumed to operate within a steady, but possibly sheared, wind or current velocity. For marine hydrokinetic energy applications, the presence of a river/tidal channel bed and water surface boundaries may be modeled.",
