    "description": "This is a method of performing trilinear analysis on large data sets using a modification of the PARAFAC-ALS algorithm.  It iteratively decomposes the data matrix into a core matrix and three loading matrices based on the Tucker1 model.  The algorithm is particularly useful for data sets that are too large to upload into a computer?s main memory.  While the performance advantage in utilizing our algorithm is dependent on the number of data elements and dimensions of the data array, we have seen a significant performance improvement over operating PARAFAC-ALS on the full data set.\nSAND2020-12649 M\n\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
