    "description": "GPU-FPX is a tool based on NVBit that detects and analyzes floating-point exceptions on NVIDIA GPUs through binary instrumentation. Its purpose is to detect and report the occurrences of floating-point exceptions during numerical computations, offering efficient location detections and exception flow. GPUFPX achieves exceptional performance, being 16x faster than comparable prior tools, such as BinFPE.",
