    "description": "OpenSHMEM is a community effort to unifyt and standardize the SHMEM programming model. MPI (Message Passing Interface) is a well-known community standard for parallel programming using distributed memory. The most recen t release of MPI, version 3.0, was designed in part to support programming models like SHMEM.OSHMPI is an implementation of the OpenSHMEM standard using MPI-3 for the Linux operating system. It is the first implementation of SHMEM over MPI one-sided communication and has the potential to be widely adopted due to the portability and widely availability of Linux and MPI-3. OSHMPI has been tested on a variety of systems and implementations of MPI-3, includingInfiniBand clusters using MVAPICH2 and SGI shared-memory supercomputers using MPICH. Current support is limited to Linux but may be extended to Apple OSX if there is sufficient interest. The code is opensource via https://github.com/jeffhammond/oshmpi",
