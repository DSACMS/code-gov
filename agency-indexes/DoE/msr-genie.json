    "description": "MSR-Genie is a vendor-neutral tool for fast and efficient queries about model-specific registers (MSRs).\nThe tool allows end users to query bi-directionally across MSR lists as well as processor families and\nmodels, and provides them with guidance on appropriate bitmasks. The msr-genie tool is open-source\nand easily extensible, and currently supports 30 Intel processor models and two-thousand unique MSRs.",
