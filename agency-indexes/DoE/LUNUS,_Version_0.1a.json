    "description": "LUNUS software for generating 3D maps of diffuse scattering from macromolecular X-ray crystallography diffraction images. A set of tools needed for advanced refinement of crystal structures and crystallographic charge density models. Includes tools for processing X--ray diffraction images, charge density maps, and structure factors for analysis of diffuse X-ray scattering and charge density variations in crystallography. Specific methods include: elementary algebraic operations on images and 3D lattices; fourier transform of images and 3D lattices; image processing to measure diffuse intensity; crystallographic refinement; and 3D integration of diffuse intensity.",
