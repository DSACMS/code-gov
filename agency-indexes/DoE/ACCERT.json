    "description": "The main function of ACCERT (The Algorithm for the Capital Cost Estimation of Reactor Technologies) is to provide an item-by-item estimate of the cost of a facility, at present a nuclear reactor complex, primarily nuclear power stations. The core of ACCERT is the large number of algorithms that have been developed and will continue to be developed. ACCERT is also a general methodology \nfor identifying and organizing the individual items that are estimated using the ACCERT algorithms. \nACCERT also summarize status and results; to save results and pull information from previous analyses; and to provide an interactive dynamic graphical user interface for a wide range of functions and visualizations.",
