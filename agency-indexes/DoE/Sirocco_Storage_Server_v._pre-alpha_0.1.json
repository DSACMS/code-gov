    "description": "Sirocco is a parallel storage system under development, designed for write-intensive workloads on large-scale HPC platforms. It implements a keyvalue object store on top of a set of loosely federated storage servers that cooperate to ensure data integrity and performance. It includes support for a range of different types of storage transactions. This software release constitutes a conformant storage server, along with the client-side libraries to access the storage over a network.",
