    "description": "This software is for an application, designed for phones and/or tablets, to assist microbiome researchers collecting samples in the field to also collect metadata in a standardized and systematic way. The type of samples covered would be e.g. soil sample from a forest, sediment sample from a lake, or water sample in the ocean. The app allows users to collect sample information and metadata in an easy and intuitive way, and connects to the NMDC submission portal (https://data.microbiomedata.org/submission/home) a website from where users can review the samples they collected and add more information if necessary.",
