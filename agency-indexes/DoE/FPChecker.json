    "description": "CUDA is the programming model used to program NVIDIA GPUs, which are widely used in DOE supercomputers. FPChecker allows programmers to detect and fix hidden exceptions in the floating-point computations that CUDA executes. When a floating-point exception occurs (e.g., division by zero), GPUs cannot catch these errors. FPChecker intercepts each floating-point operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) and reports to users where exceptions occur (file and line of code).",
