    "description": "Two quantum graph algorithms (as python scripts) that run on the D-Wave Quantum Annealer are included for copyright. The Quantum Graph Partitioning software takes a graph as input and the number of partitions of equal size desired. This is transformed into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) that is run as a quantum-classical algorithm using D-Wave/qbsolv. The Quantum Community Detection software takes a graph and the maximum number of communities/clusters desired. This is transformed into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) that is run as a quantum-classical algorithm using D-Wave/qbsolv.",
