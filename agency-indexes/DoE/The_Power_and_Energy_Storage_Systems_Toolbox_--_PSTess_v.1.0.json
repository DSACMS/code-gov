    "description": "The Power and Energy Storage Systems Toolbox (PSTess) is a MATLAB-based computing package for dynamic simulation and analysis of utility-scale battery storage systems. This codebase is a fork of the Power Systems Toolbox Version 3.0, developed at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) and Cherry Tree Scientific Software. While PSTess shares a common lineage with PST, it is a substantially different application. As the name implies, the main distinguishing characteristic of PSTess is its ability to model inverter-based energy storage systems (ESS). The model that enables this is called ess.m, and it serves the dual role of representing ESS operational constraints and the generator/converter interface. With PSTess, the generator/converter interface is modeled as a controllable current source with the ability to modulate both active and reactive current. The model ess.m permits four-quadrant modulation, which allows it to represent a wide variety of inverter-based resources beyond energy storage when paired with an appropriate supplemental control model. Examples include utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) power plants, type 4 wind plants, and static synchronous compensators (STATCOM). This capability is especially useful for modeling hybrid plants that combine energy storage with renewable resources.
