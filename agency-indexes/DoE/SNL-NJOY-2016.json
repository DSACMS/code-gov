    "description": "This is a wrapper around the LANL NJOY-2016 code that interfaces with extended code capabilities and minor modification of the LANL NJOY-2016 code that supports modeling radiation damage to materials. The NJOY Nuclear Data Processing System is a modular computer code designed to read evaluated data in ENDF format, transform the data in various ways, and output the results as libraries designed to be used in various applications. The wrapper provided here permits Sandia-specific control parameters to be used in the input data file. The modifications incorporated here enhance the ability of NJOY to address material damage response functions for many materials, e.g. to include the NRT and arc-dpa forms of the damage energy in addition to the default NJOY-2016 implementation of the sharp-threshold Kinchin-Pease threshold energy treatment. All of the modifications provided here are being made available to the GitHub-based NJOY-2016 code. As useful enhancements found here are incorporated into the baseline NJOY-2016 code, they will be eliminated from this version so as to maintain our compatibility with the baseline NJOY-2016 code.
