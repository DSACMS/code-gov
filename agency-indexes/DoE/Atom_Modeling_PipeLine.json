    "description": "This repository contains code for the computational framework to build ML models for drug discovery\npurposes. \n\nOur end-to-end pipeline extracts features from model-ready datasets and trains and saves the model to our model zoo or to disk.\n\nOur pipeline generates a variety of molecular features and both shallow and deep ML models.\n\nThe HPC-specific module we have developed conducts efficient parallelized search of the model hyperparameter space and reports the best-performing hyperparameters for each of these feature/model combinations.",
