    "description": "SPEMMCRA provides a low-cost simulated method to provide for testing of control theory and cybersecurity approaches to microgrid implementations. Specifically, this physics-based approach provides realistic responses to compare control strategies in simulation, but also to demonstrate actions that can or cannot be taken in taking cybersecurity actions . As communications interfaces or other actions are taken that affect the flow of data, SPEMMCRA can show whether the microgrid operation is adversely affected by what is intended to mitigate a cybersecurity event.",
