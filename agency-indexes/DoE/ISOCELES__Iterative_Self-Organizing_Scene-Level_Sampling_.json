    "description": "ISOSCLES (Iterative Self-Organizing SCene LEvel Sampling) is a hierarchical, unsupervised method for obtaining a set of image chips for training convolutional neural networks. ISOSCELES operates at two levels, first selecting representative images from a full image domain and then performing unsupervised clustering of potential samples from each of those scenes to obtain a final set of sample chips that then can be labelled or used for unsupervised training. This technique was first designed to support building extraction tasks using Maxar 4-band imagery from WorldView-2, WorldView-3, Quickbird-2, or GeoEye, but can be modified to work with other image sources.",
