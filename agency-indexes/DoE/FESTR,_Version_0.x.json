    "description": "FESTR is a modeling tool for calculating spectroscopic-quality synthetic outputs (e.g., spectra and images) based on (in general) the time evolutions of 3-D spatial distributions of materials characterized by their chemical composition, temperature, and density conditions. FESTR performs raytracing across unstructured meshes, builds intrinsic optical properties of mixed materials by performing equation-of-state lookups in external data, and then solves the radiation-transport equation along rays to obtain emergent time and space resolved synthetic spectra. These results can be further processed into time and/or space integrated spectra, as well as into spectral-band-integrated synthetic images, radiated power histories, and total radiated energy values. FESTR is also applicable to spatial reconstructions of material properties via the analysis of experimental data.",
