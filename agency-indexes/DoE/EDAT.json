    "description": "SAND2022-13281 O\nEDAT is a suite of tools for analyzing time-dependent electron densities produced by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) simulations of ion-irradiated materials and surfaces. The code\u2019s key capabilities include various routines to extract the number of electrons emitted from a surface, the energy spectrum of these emitted electrons, and the number of electrons captured by the ion. The code is written in Python and can interface with multiple TDDFT codes.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
