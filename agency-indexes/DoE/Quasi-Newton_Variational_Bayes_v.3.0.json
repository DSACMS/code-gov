    "description": "SAND2024-09052O\nQuasi-Newton Variational Bayes (QNVB) is a training algorithm that performs high-dimensional variational inference on machine learning models. It provides mechanisms to calibrate and control model uncertainty during training. The PyTorch implementation of projective integral updates for Gaussian mean-fields supports the manuscript, \"Projective Integral Updates for High-Dimensional Variational Inference.\"\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
