    "description": "AMES-Fit is a program used to automatically fit the multi-field solid-state NMR spectra of half-integer quadrupolar nuclei. Due to the high dimensional space, gradient algorithms have failed to address the fitting of such data, which is at present done manually. AMES-Fit diverges from these approaches by using an adaptive step size random search algorithm to fit the NMR spectra to consistently find the global best fit parameters.",
