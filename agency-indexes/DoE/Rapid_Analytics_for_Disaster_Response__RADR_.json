    "description": "Rapid Analytics for Disaster Response (RADR) is a disaster response and situational awareness system that provides actionable insights using image analytics derived from optical and radar-based remotely-sensed imagery (optical and radar satellite, airborne, UAS). Geospatial analysis can also interface with the image analytic results to understand potential impacts to critical infrastructure assets. The rapid response is driven by a lifecycle workflow that spans event monitoring and action, image acquisition and retrieval, image pre-processing, image analytics algorithm deployment, analytics packaging, and analytics delivery.",
