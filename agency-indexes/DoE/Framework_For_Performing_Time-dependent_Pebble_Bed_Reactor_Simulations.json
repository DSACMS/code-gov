    "description": "The present work details the creation of a high-fidelity Monte Carlo methodology for analyzing the run-in and subsequent approach to equilibrium for PBRs. The methodology entails a Python module wrapped around Serpent so as to perform neutronics calculations, move pebbles, refuel the core, and discharge pebbles, thereby modeling the explicit behavior of the PBR run-in. The code kugelpy is within the GitHub repository `pyrates`.",
