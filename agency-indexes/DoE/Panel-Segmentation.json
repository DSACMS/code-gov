    "description": "The Panel-Segmentation package is a computer vision (CV) framework for automated metadata extraction for solar PV arrays using satellite imagery. With Panel-Segmentation, a user inputs a set of latitude-longitude coordinates to automatically generate a satellite image using the Google Maps API, and runs the image through a deep learning framework to get a pixel-by-pixel representation of the solar panel(s) in an image. If a solar array is located, the user can then perform spectral clustering to cluster individual solar arrays in an image (if applicable), and run each cluster through an azimuth estimation algorithm. This package framework is versatile, allowing for future CV techniques to be added and/or modified. ",
