    "description": "mkite is a distributed computing platform for materials simulation. mkite is built with the server-client pattern, decoupling production databases from client runners. When used in combination with message brokers, mkite enables any available client to perform calculations without prior hardware specification on the server side. Furthermore, the software enables the creation of complex workflows with multiple inputs and branches, facilitating the exploration of combinatorial chemical spaces. The mkite suite provides recipes and tools to interact with package such as VASP, but is extensible to any other simulation package. Finally, mkite helps keeping the provenance of calculations in a SQL database. A complete description of the software is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08841.",
