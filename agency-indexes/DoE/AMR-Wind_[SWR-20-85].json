    "description": "AMR-Wind is a massively parallel, block-structured adaptive-mesh, incompressible flow solver for wind turbine and wind farm simulations. The solver is built on top of the AMReX library. AMReX is developed at LBNL , NREL , and ANL as part of the Block-Structured AMR Co-Design Center in DOE's Exascale Computing Project. AMReX library provides the mesh data structures, mesh adaptivity, as well as the linear solvers used for solving the governing equations. The primary applications for AMR-Wind are: performing large-eddy simulations (LES) of atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flows, simulating wind farm turbine-wake interactions using actuator disk or actuator line models for turbines, and as a background solver when coupled with a near-body solver with overset methodology to perform blade-resolved simulations of multiple wind turbines within a wind farm.",
