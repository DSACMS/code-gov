    "description": "Additive Manufacturing, video dataset Two-photon lithography (TPL) is a widely used 3D nanoprinting technique that uses laser light to create objects. Challenges to large-scale adoption of this additive manufacturing method include identifying light dosage parameters and monitoring during fabrication. A research team from LLNL, Iowa State University, and Georgia Tech is applying machine learning models to tackle these challenges-i.e., accelerate the process of identifying optimal light dosage parameters and automate the detection of part quality. Funded by LLNL's Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program, the project team has curated a video dataset of TPL processes for parameters such as light dosages, photo-curable resins, and structures. Both raw and labeled versions of the datasets are available on the links in the Open Data Initiative page. The code uses the labeled dataset.
