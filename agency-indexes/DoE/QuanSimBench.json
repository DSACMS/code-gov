    "description": "QuanSimBench is a software program that performs a gate-by-gate simulation of a quantum computer with a full state vector formulation. It simulates a simplified version of Shor's algorithm with increasing number of qubits until resources are exhausted. The score (states/s) is how fast the Approximate Quantum Fourier Transform can be computed (the modular exponentiation is not timed). The goal is to quantify the ability of a computer to simulate ideal quantum circuits.",
