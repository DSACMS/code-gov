    "description": "Camellia offers a framework for development of solvers for the discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin methodology of Demkowicz and Gopalakrishnan as well as other finite element methodologies. Spatially 1D-3D meshes are supported, and space-time elements are supported for all spatial topologies. Both h and p adaptivity are supported. A general interface for direct and iterative solvers is provided; a geometric multigrid preconditioner is also provided. The core computational kernels take advantage of MPI to execute in parallel.",
