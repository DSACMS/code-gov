    "description": "SAND2022-14694 O CrystalVR is a CAD2VR plugin which enables the import of crystallographic information files (CIF) into a virtual reality (VR) environment for visualization and interaction. Crystallographic data is incredibly complex and difficult to navigate and visualize on a two-dimensional or 2D screen. CrystalVR empowers users to step inside their crystals, allowing them to intuitively grow, shrink, and scale the crystal structure. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
