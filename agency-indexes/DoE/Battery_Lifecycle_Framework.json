    "description": "The Battery Lifecycle (BLC) Framework is an open-source platform that provides tools to visualize and share battery data from material characterization, cell testing, manufacturing, and field testing through the technology development cycle. BLC has three components: data importers, a front-end for querying the data and creating visualizations, and an application programming interface to provide access to the data from Python. BLC has been deployed for tracking the development of a battery from the lab to a manufacturing line and systems installed in the field and for comparing studies of multiple cells of the same battery chemistry and configuration. The code was developed around Redash, a robust open-source extract-transform-load engine. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.
