    "description": "Suite of tools designed to simply data collection, extraction, reduction, and plotting for resonant soft x-ray scattering experiments performed at ALS beamline 4.0.2; speeds up the process of converting data into meaningful information for users to publish experimental results. \n\n* Python software routines for processing CCD images, including reciprocal space maps, diffraction peak alignment, resonant spectral profiles, line-cut comparisons, coordinate transforms, etc. \n* Scan file generator, optimized for typical uses cases, reduces burden on users by handling complex operations behind the scenes of a simplified user interface \n* Deployed at beamline endstation computers; packaged and deployable as standardized PyPI package \n* Under version control (git) and hosted on LBL-sponsored repository (bitbucket)",
