    "description": "A b-MATCHING is a subset of edges M such that at most b(v) edges in M are incident on each vertex v, where b(v) is specified. We present a distributed-memory parallel algorithm, b-SUITOR, that computes a b-MATCHING with more than half the maximum weight in a graph with weights on the edges",
