    "description": "This is the code for the paper [Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Mesh\nRefinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00801), published at AAMAS 2023. It contains the implementation\nof a new algorithm, called Value Decomposition Graph Network (VDGN), for applying multi-agent\nreinforcement learning to the problem of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). It also contains the\nimplementation of a multi-agent environment for AMR on a linear advection problem. VDGN is the first\nlearning algorithm to display anticipatory refinement behavior in AMR, and it outperforms local error\nthreshold-based heuristic strategies.",
