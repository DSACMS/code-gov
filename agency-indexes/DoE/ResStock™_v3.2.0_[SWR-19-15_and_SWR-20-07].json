    "description": "The ResStock\u2122 analysis tool was built on NREL's OpenStudio\u00ae platform, and is a project geared at modeling existing residential building stocks at national, regional, or local scales with a high-degree of granularity (e.g., one physics-based simulation model for every 200 dwelling units), using the EnergyPlus\u00ae simulation engine. Information about ComStock\u2122, a sister tool for modeling the commercial building stock, can be found here: https://www.nrel.gov/buildings/comstock.html\nThis repository contains:\nHousing characteristics of the U.S. residential building stock, in the form of conditional probability distributions stored as tab-separated value (.tsv) files. Comments at the bottom of each file document data sources and assumptions for each.\nA library of housing characteristic \"options\" that translate high-level characteristic parameters into arguments for OpenStudio measures, and which are referenced by the housing characteristic .tsv files and building energy upgrades defined in project definition files\nProject definition files:\nv2.3.0 and later: buildstockbatch YML files openable in any text editor\nv2.2.5 and prior: Project folder openable in PAT\nUnit-level OpenStudio Measures for automatically constructing OpenStudio Models of each representative dwelling unit model:\nv3.0.0 and later: OpenStudio-HPXML Measures\nv2.5.0 and prior: OpenStudio Measures\nHigher-level OpenStudio Measures for controlling simulation inputs and outputs\nThis repository does not contain software for running ResStock simulations, which can be found as follows:\n\nVersions 2.3.0 and later only support the use of buildstockbatch for deploying simulations on high-performance or cloud computing. Version 2.3.0 also removed separate projects for single-family detached and multifamily buildings, in lieu of a combined project_national representing the U.S. residential building stock. See the changelog for more details.\nVersions 2.2.5 and prior support the use of the publicly available OpenStudio-PAT software as an interface for deploying simulations on cloud computing.
