    "description": "A re-implementation of Quantile Kriging.\n\nQuantile Kriging was described by Matthew Plumlee & Rui Tuo in their 2014 paper \"Building Accurate Emulators for Stochastic Simulations via Quantile Kriging.\" \n\nWith computational savings when dealing with replication from the recent paper \"Practical heteroskedastic Gaussian process modeling for large simulation experiments\u201d, it is now possible to apply Quantile Kriging to a wider class of problems. \n\nIn addition to fitting the model, other useful tools are provided such as the ability to automatically perform leave-one-out cross validation.",
