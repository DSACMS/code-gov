    "description": "Symmetry-protected subspaces in quantum systems are subspaces demarcated by a conserved quantity of that quantum system. We introduce two classical algorithms, which efficiently compute and elucidate features of these subspaces. The first algorithm explores the entire symmetry-protected subspace of an initial state in time complexity linear to the size of the subspace by closing local basis state-to-basis state transitions. The second algorithm determines, with bounded error, if a given measurement outcome of a dynamically-generated state is within the symmetry-protected subspace of the state in which the dynamical system is initialized. This software is paired with the paper of the same name at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.08586.pdf.",
