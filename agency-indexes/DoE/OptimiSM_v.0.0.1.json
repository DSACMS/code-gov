    "description": "SAND2021-15062 O OptimiSM is a library for solving solid mechanics problems and for rapid prototyping of computational solid mechanics research ideas. It was originally created to facilitate research and development of algorithms for contact mechanics. It is a realization of a philosophy that problems can be represented with variational least-action principles, even when there is history-dependent material behavior and contact. This opens the door to using powerful methods from non-convex optimization for solutions. The code was successful in its original purpose, but along the way, the authors realized that it could be of general use to the computational solid mechanics research community as an R&D platform. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
