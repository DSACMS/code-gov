    "description": "Boxfish is a tool for visualizing performance data. It allows users to quickly project performance data gathered from parallel applications onto intuitive domains. It also includes a projection mechanism that automatically finds relations in performance data so the the data can easily be mapped onto non-obviously related domains. For this release, Boxfish allows performance data to be projected onto the nodes and links of a computer network, as well as onto grids or patch-structured applications. This allows a user of the visualization tool to quickly see correlations between performance data and network structure, application data, or communication patterns.",
