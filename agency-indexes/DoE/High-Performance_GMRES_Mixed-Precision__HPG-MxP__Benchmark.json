    "description": "SAND2024-08539O\nThe High Performance GMRES Mixed-Precision (HPG-MxP) is a benchmark for ranking high-performance supercomputers, allowing use of mixed-precision. Similar to HPCG benchmark, it is designed to profile the computers' capabilities to perform the computational and communication tasks that are commonly found in important classes of real-world applications. At the same time, like HPL-MxP benchmark, it allows the use of mixed-precision arithmetic, while ensuring the double-precision accuracy of the computed solution.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
