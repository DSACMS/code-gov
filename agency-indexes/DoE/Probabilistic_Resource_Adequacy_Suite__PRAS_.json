    "description": "The Probabilistic Resource Adequacy Suite (PRAS) provides an open-source, research-oriented collection of tools for analysing the resource adequacy of a bulk power system. The simulation methods offered support everything from classical convolution-based analytical techniques through to high-performance sequential Monte Carlo methods supporting multi-region composite reliability assessment, including simulation of energy-limited resources such as storage.",
