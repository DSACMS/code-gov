    "description": "meraculous2 is a whole genome shotgun assembler for short-reads that is capable of assembling large, polymorphic genomes with modest computational requirements. Meraculous relies on an efficient and conservative traversal of the subgraph of the k-mer (deBruijn) graph of oligonucleotides with unique high quality extensions in the dataset, avoiding an explicit error correction step as used in other short-read assemblers. Additional features include (1) handling of allelic variation using \"bubble\" structures within the deBruijn graph, (2) gap closing of repetitive and low quality regions using localized assemblies, and (3) an improved scaffolding algorithm that produces more complete assemblies without compromising on scaffolding accuracy",
