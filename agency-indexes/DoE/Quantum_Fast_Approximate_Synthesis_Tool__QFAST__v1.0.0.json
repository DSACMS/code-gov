    "description": "We present QFAST, a quantum synthesis tool designed to produce short circuits and to scale well in practice. Our contributions are: 1) a novel representation of circuits able to encode placement and topology; 2) a hierarchical approach with an iterative refinement formulation that combines \"coarse-grained\" fast optimization during circuit structure search with a good, but slower, optimization stage only in the final circuit instantiation stage. When compared against state-of-the-art techniques, although not optimal, QFAST can generate much shorter circuits for \"time dependent evolution\" algorithms used by domain scientists. We also show the composability and tunability of our formulation in terms of circuit depth and running time. For example, we show how to generate shorter circuits by plugging in the best available third party synthesis algorithm at a given hierarchy level. Composability enables portability across chip architectures, which is missing from the available approaches.",
