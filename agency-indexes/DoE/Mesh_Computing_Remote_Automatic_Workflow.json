    "description": "The software suite uses a microservice architecture using Docker and `docker-compose`. The microservices are as follows:\n1. User interface. This interface is written in JavaScript using the Svelte framework. It exposes form elements and a 3D visualizer to prompt the user through the definition of microstructure parameters, and setting parameters for mesh generation and refinement.\n2. Mesh generator. This is a container running the Python package for DREAM3D to generate a voxelized mesh that represents a microstructure defined by the user in the interface.\n3. Cubit runner. This is a secure shell protocol tool that makes the submitting the DREAM mesh to an HPC instance and starts to run Cubit shell commands to smooth the grain boundaries with its `sculpt` library, applies user-defined boundary node sets, and bundles and returns the simulation-ready meshes and input files as a zipped directory.",
