    "description": "SAND2021-1511 O. The code takes a description of a system comprised of two leads that are sources and sinks of electrons, a set of abstract sites that those electrons can occupy, and their connectivity. It then predicts the current passing between the two leads through the set of abstract sites. There are numerical parameters that define the rate at which electrons tunnel between sites and another parameter that determines the energy of having two electrons on the same site. When the ratio of these energies and biases are set just right, they can be used to predict the existence of Coulomb blockade in which no current flows because the energetic penalty would be too high. That is, the code predicts a current and the absence of a current which is predictive of Coulomb blockade.
