    "description": "Tempus is a software framework for the time integration of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), partial differential equations (PDEs), and differential-algebraic equations (DAEs).  Examples of time-integration methods available are Forward Euler, Backward Euler, Explicit Runge-Kutta and Implicit Runge-Kutta methods.  Tempus can be used from small systems of equations (e.g., single ODEs for the time evolution of plasticity models) to large-scale transient simulations requiring exascale computing (e.g., flow fields around reentry vehicles and magneto-hydrodynamics).  Tempus will be released as part of Trilinos under a BSD open source license.",
