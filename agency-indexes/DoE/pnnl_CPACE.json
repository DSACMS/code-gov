    "description": "C-PACE Market Assessment Tool This tool was developed for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE) Working Group to support state and local governments creating, joining, and implementing C-PACE programs. This tool allows users to input a jurisdiction (city, county, or state) and automate a report with building characteristics, energy use, and energy efficiency savings opportunities for commercial buildings in that jurisdiction. The report generated by the tool identifies jurisdiction-specific energy end uses, building use types, and building technologies that a local C-PACE program should consider focusing on to more effectively allocate limited resources and maximize energy savings and investment.",
