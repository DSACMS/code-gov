    "description": "NMACFoam is a computational fluid dynamics tool for simulating flow and solids transport in membrane-spacer channels pertaining to reverse osmosis or nanofiltration applications. It is developed on the OpenFOAM framework and allows for simulating spacers with complex geometries. It includes porous wall boundary conditions for membranes and can accurately capture concentration polarization effects. One can perform large calculations at module-scale domain sizes using high performance computing resources with NMACFoam, which scales to 1000s of processors for problems with 1-10 million cells.",
