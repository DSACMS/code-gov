    "description": "FUDGEFudge provides (Python based) tools to:\n\u2022 Store and modify nuclear data.\n\u2022 Convert ENDF-6 formatted nuclear data [1] into Generalized Nuclear\nData (GND) structure [2].\n\u2022 Convert LLNL\u2019s ENDL formatted nuclear data [3] into GND.\n\u2022 Plot data from GND files.\n\u2022 Check for physics problems in GND files.\n\u2022 Process nuclear data for use by Monte Carlo and/or deterministic\ncodes. Fudge contains hooks for the future addition of nuclear data\nprocessing routines.\nThe Fudge release includes samples of published ENDF-6 formatted data that\ncan be converted to the new GND format.\nThis software is the next release in a series of releases that began with GND\nversion 0.1 [2].",
