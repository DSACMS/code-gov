    "description": "Diventi provides a write optimized index of network logs such as netflow or zeek. The program will ingest various network traffic logs (zeek connection logs or NetflowV5, v9 or IPFix logs) and index each IP address and time of its activity. This database can then be queried for timely tracking of network activity. It currently uses the ft-index library from Percona but is adaptable to any key-value store that supports the Berkeley DB api.SAND2019-15037 M\n\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
