    "description": "ImpactX is the next generation of the IMPACT-Z code. It is a s-based simulation code for modeling intense beams in particle accelerators using symplectic tracking methods and includes collective effects. It is multi-node parallel and supports modern compute hardware such as GPUs, modern algorithms such as mesh-refinement and realistic geometries (embedded boundaries).",
