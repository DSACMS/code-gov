    "description": "The MultiThreaded Graph Library (MTGL) is a set of header files that implement graph algorithm in such a way that they can run on massively multithreaded architectures. It is based upon the Boost Graph Library, but doesn't use Boost since the latter doesn't run well on these architectures.",
