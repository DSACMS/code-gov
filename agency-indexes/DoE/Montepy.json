    "description": "Montepy is an object-oriented  Python  interface for  MCNP input files. It excels at reading, editing, creating, and writing MCNP input files. The Monte Carlo N Particle (MCNP) code is a Monte Carlo transport solver for simulating many different types of radiation problems and is developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory. Montepy creates an object-oriented interface for the MCNP input file to allow for efficient automated modifications to large, complex simulations.",
