    "description": "This Fortran code focuses on traveltime computation and tomography based on eikonal equation. Specifically, the package provides three major functionalities: (1) forward modeling of traveltime from single-point or ensemble source based on factorized eikonal equation, (2) adjoint-state first-arrival traveltime tomography based on picked first arrival traveltime using steepest descent, conjugate gradient, or limited-memory BFGS inversion scheme, and (3) adjoint-state joint transmission-reflection tomography based on picked first-arrival and reflection traveltimes. The package applies to forward modeling and tomography based on traveltime in 2D and 3D isotropic regular-grid models. We name this package LATTE \u2013 Los Alamos TravelTime package based on Eikonal equation.  \n\n* The code is for accompanying a journal paper under preparation. The paper will be submitted via LA-UR separately later.",
