    "description": "The Terascale Simulation Tools and Technologies (TSTT) center is a collaboration between several universities and DOE laboratories, and is funded by the DOE Scientific Discovery for Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program. The primary objective of the (TSTT) center is to develop technologies that enable application scientists to easily use multiple mesh and discretization strageties within a single simulation on terascale computers. This is accomplished through the development of common functional interfaces to geometry, mesh, and other simulation data. This package is Sandia's implementation of these interfaces.",
