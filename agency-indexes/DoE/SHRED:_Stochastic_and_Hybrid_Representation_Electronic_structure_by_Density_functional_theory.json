    "description": "The stochastic and hybrid representation electronic structure by density functional theory (SHRED) calculates microscopic material properties using time-dependent, nonadiabatic, and ground-state density functional theory (DFT) with a periodic basis. It can utilize deterministic, stochastic, and hybrid representations of the electronic orbitals. This provides a capability for highly parallelized computation of DFT for larger systems and/or higher temperatures. Thus, the code is particularly suited for calculation of material properties in the warm and hot dense matter regimes.",
