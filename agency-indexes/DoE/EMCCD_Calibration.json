    "description": "The program \u201cEMCCD Calibration\u201d is software to provide accurate calibration of the gain and analogue-to-digital conversation factor for a variety of scientific imaging devices, such as electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) cameras, complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (sCMOS), and intensified charge coupled device (ICCD) cameras. The software implements new calibration methods that are described in a manuscript intended for publication under the title \u201cFrom Noise to Harmony: Calibration Methods for Electron Multiplying CCD Cameras\u201d. The software provides ready-to-use tools for researchers using EMCCD, sCMOS, or ICCD cameras.",
