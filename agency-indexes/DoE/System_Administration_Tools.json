    "description": "High Performance Computing clusters and supercomputers are expensive and complex systems to manage. The software tools to manage these systems are also aging to the point where they are no longer actively developed and their methodology is antiquated. There has been a surge of new methodologies and software tools developed by the cloud providers to maximize availability of services and scalability of server deployment. The authors would like to utilize these new software tools to distribute our proof of concept, named Kraken, that will be responsible for booting and managing LANL's HPC systems in the future",
