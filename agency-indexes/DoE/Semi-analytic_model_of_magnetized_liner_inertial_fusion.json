    "description": "The code that was developed is called SAMM (Semi-Analytic MagLIF Model). In 2015, McBride and Slutz published all of the equations that are solved by the code in the original SAMM paper: R. D. McBride and S. A. Slutz, ?A semi-analytic model of magnetized liner inertial fusion?, Phys. Plasmas 22, 052708 (2015); http://doi.org/10.1063/1.4918953. The SAMM code is now implemented in both the MATLAB and Python programming languages. Students from multiple universities have requested copies of the code so that they can become more familiar with the MagLIF concept. We would like to seek an open-source solution. There is no market value to this code, as there are plenty of more sophisticated simulation codes already available; SAMM is merely a simplified model that is purely for educational purposes. In fact, at least one graduate student (from the University of California, San Diego) has already implemented and published his own modified version of the model: J. Narkis, H. U. Rahman, J. C. Valenzuela, F. Conti, R. D. McBride, D. Venosa, and F. N. Beg, ?A semi-analytic model of gas-puff liner-on-target magneto-inertial fusion?, Phys. Plasmas 26, 032708 (2019); https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5086056.
