    "description": "There is a need to easily and uniformly capture, access, enrich, organize, search, and collaborate on working scientific data sets across geographically distributed experiment, computation, and data analytics facilities. DataFed provides a set of services and applications enabling simple and uniform cross-facility scientific data management with federated (distributed) data repositories.  This solution greatly reduces effort required by scientist to organize and/or move data between facilities/institutes,  Reduces likelihood of misidentification and subsequent misuse of data, and improves scientific reproducibility through deep, domain-specific context and provenance capture.",
