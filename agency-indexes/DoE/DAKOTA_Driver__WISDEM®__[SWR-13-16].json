    "description": "OpenMDAO driver for DAKOTA (Design Analysis Kit for Optimization and Terascale Applications). This code connects the SANDIA National Laboratory's C++-based DAKOTA optimization and analysis tool with NASA\u2019s python-based openMDAO systems engineering framework. It allows DAKOTA to be used as an openMDAO \u201cDriver\u201d. DAKOTA contains a wide array of advanced sensitivity, uncertainty quantification, and optimization methods. These are now available in a \u201cpluggable\u201d way to any openMDAO based workflow.",
