    "description": "XSPIKE (eXplore the SPIKE protein) identifies sites of high variability (high entropy) in amino acid sequences of the Spike protein of the SARS CoV-2 virus.  Among these sites, it further identifies correlations between pairs of them, and provides both graphical and tabular display of that information.  It also provides a table of occurrences of co-occurring patterns found among natural sequences, featuring associations within those most highly variable sites to emphasize common covariation patterns; this table includes information about the number of sequences in which those patterns are seen, broken out by continent, and provides as context a list of mutations for each pattern that corresponds to the differences between the reference sequence (usually the Wuhan form) and the most common full sequence that exhibits that pattern.",
