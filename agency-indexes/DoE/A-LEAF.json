    "description": "A-LEAF is an electricity market simulation framework. It includes models for short-term market operations and long-term investment planning of generation, storage, and transmission. Model formulations include least cost and two-stage market equilibrium. Simulations can be flexibly structured over one or more years, including options for periodic samples or jumping to a single future year. Years can be simulated as 365 consecutive days at hourly or 5-minute sample rates, or they can be subsampled using a representative day group selection algorithm.",
