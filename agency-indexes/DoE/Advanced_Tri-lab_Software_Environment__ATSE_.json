    "description": "The Advanced Tri-lab Software Environment (ATSE) is an effort to build an open, modular, extensible, community-engaged, and vendor-adaptable software ecosystem that enables the prototyping of new technologies for improving the ASC computing environment. The initial target for ATSE is to accelerate the maturity of the Arm ecosystem for supporting ASC computing and the high-performance computing community more broadly. ATSE provides an integrated and optimized software stack that includes: 1) Application development environment and libraries including compilers, math libraries, tools, MPI, and OpenMP, 2) Low-level system software including optimized Linux, network stack, file systems, containers, and virtual machines, 3) Job scheduling and management including workload manager, application launcher, and user tools, and 4) System administration and management tools supporting booting, monitoring, and operating system image management.
