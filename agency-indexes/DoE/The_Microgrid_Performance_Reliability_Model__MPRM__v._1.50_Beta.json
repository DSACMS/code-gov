    "description": "The MPRM is a simulation code that is used to statistically quantify the performance and reliability of a microgrid operating in islanded mode. Performance can be expressed in terms of fuel efficiency, renewable penetration, and other operational characteristics of the grid.  Reliability can be expressed in terms of frequency and magnitude of load loss on a tier-by-tier, bus-by-bus basis or on an",
