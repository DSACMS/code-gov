    "description": "Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images provide a variety of structural and morphological\ninformation for the characterization of the nanomaterials. This code offers automatic recognition and\nquantitative analysis of SEM images in a high-throughput manner using computer vision and machine\nlearning techniques. The main function of this application is to extract particle size and morphology\ninformation of overlapping nanoparticles and core-shell nanostructures in a user friendly interface. The\ncode is written in C++ with QT environment, and has been tested on MacOSX.",
