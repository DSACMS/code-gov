    "description": "FlexFlow is a deep learning framework and engine, built using the Legion Programming System, that accelerates distributed deep neural network training by automatically discovering fast parallelization strategies.  This is achieved by using a guided randomized search to find a fast parallelization strategy for a specific parallel machine architecture. To accelerate this search, FlexFlow introduces a novel execution simulator that can accurately predict a parallelization strategy\u2019s performance and is three orders of magnitude faster than prior approaches that execute each strategy.  FlexFlow currently out-performs common industry software frameworks like Google's TensorFlow/Keras and Facebook's PyTorch by factors ranging from 3 to 15 times.",
