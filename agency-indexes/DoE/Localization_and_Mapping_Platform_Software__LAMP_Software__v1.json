    "description": "The Localization and Mapping Platform (LAMP) software fuses radiation and contextual data to produce 3-D maps that locate and identify gamma-ray emitting sources in complex environments. It enables data collection, fusion, and processing in near-real-time and on-board in several configurations, including handheld and unmanned aerial system (UAS) form factors.",
