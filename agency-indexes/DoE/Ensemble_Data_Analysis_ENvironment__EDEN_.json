    "description": "The EDEN toolkit facilitates exploratory data analysis and visualization of global climate model simulation datasets. EDEN provides an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) that helps the user visually construct dynamic queries of the characteristically large climate datasets using temporal ranges, variable selections, and geographic areas of interest. EDEN reads the selected data into a multivariate visualization panel which features an extended implementation of parallel coordinates plots as well as interactive scatterplots. The user can query data in the visualization panel using mouse gestures to analyze different ranges of data. The visualization panel provides coordinated multiple views whereby selections made in one plot are propagated to the other plots.",
