    "description": "Generating a CTF (thermal-hydraulics subchannel code) model can be time consuming and error prone because of the rigid formatting of the input file and the amount of input requirements. Because of the structured input format, making small changes to a model can require large scale changes to the input file. Furthermore, a user typically has to perform calculations to develop CTF input parameters from actual model geometry. Changing model geometry requires re-calculating input parameters and copying them from wherever the calculation was performed, be it a script, spreadsheet, or piece of paper. This process complicates the quality assurance process for that model and makes changing the model more difficult. CtfDeckBuilder is an object-oriented Python interface to CTF that allows the user to build a CTF model in Python. The user no longer needs to interface with the CTF input file when using the CtfDeckBuilder. The interface reduces the information required of the user by offering defaults for most modeling options provided by CTF. The user can perform calculations directly in Python when building the model so that calculations stay with the model itself. ",
