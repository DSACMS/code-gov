    "description": "The MRSH project is a collection of the following programs: MRSH, MRCP, MRLOGIN, MRSHD, MRLOGIND. These programs are modifications of the programs RSH, RCP, RLOGIN, RSHD, and RLOGIND. They have been modified to provide authentication via munge, an intra-cluster authentication service. Henceforth, \"MRSH\" implies the collective set of programs MRSH, MRCP, MRLOGIN, MRSHD, and MRLOGIND. Similarly RSH will refer to its collective set of programs.",
