    "description": "The software provides a framework to build a fast look up layer that reflects the holdings of an archive or database and operates between search/discovery system and disk storage. The software utilizes Bloom filter (BF) data structure. The discovery service powered by the Bloom filter layer comes with a very high level of accuracy yet space-saving, since BF compresses data to fit into RAM.",
