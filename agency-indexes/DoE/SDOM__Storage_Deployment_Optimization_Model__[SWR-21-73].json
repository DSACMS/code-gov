    "description": "SDOM is designed to accurately represent the operation of energy storage across different timescales, including long-duration and seasonal applications, and the spatiotemporal diversity and complementarity among VRE sources. SDOM uses an hourly temporal resolution, a fine spatial resolution for VRE sources, and a 1-year optimization window. SDOM assumes that all builds of VRE are accompanied by sufficient additional transmission capacity to allow full utilization of these additional resources. Nuclear, hydropower, and other renewable generation (e.g., biomass and geothermal energy sources) are fixed based on operational data (time series) for a given year; thus, SDOM minimizes total system cost using conventional generators as balancing units and using VRE and storage technologies to achieve a user-defined carbon-free or renewable energy target. The total system cost includes capital costs, fixed operation-and-maintenance (FO&M) costs, variable operation-and-maintenance (VO&M) costs, and fuel cost for power generation and storage technologies.",
