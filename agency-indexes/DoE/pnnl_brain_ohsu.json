    "description": "Light sheet microscopy has made possible the 3D imaging of both fixed and live biological tissue, with samples as large as\nthe entire mouse brain. We fine-tuned an existing model, TrailMap, using expert labeled data from axonal structures in neocortex. Without\nchanging the network architecture, we implemented nnU-Net framework modifications in data augmentation, data\nforeground sampling, window learning rate, and the inference overlap method. The resulting model from these combined\napproaches yielded an improved F1 score",
