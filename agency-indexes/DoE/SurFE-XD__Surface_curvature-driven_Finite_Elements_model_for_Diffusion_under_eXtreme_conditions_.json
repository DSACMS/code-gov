    "description": "SurFE-XD is a mesoscale finite element framework to model surface diffusion under mutliphysics environments. The code uses legacy C++ library dolphin wrapped with python in a FEniCS driven unified form language and just-in-time (JIT) compilation setting. The purpose of the release is to attract wide-ranging usage of the code along with publication supplementation to support reproducibility of scientific data. SurFE-XD has been originally conceived under the LDRD-DR funding for \u201cHigh-Gradient (C-BAND) Breakdown tolerant accelerator materials project. Currently SrFE-XD support electrostatics and Thermo-elasticity driven surface diffusion kernels. Releasing the code will also enable to include contributions from other physical regimes e.g., plasticity and electrodynamics etc as well portability to GPU-based platforms.",
