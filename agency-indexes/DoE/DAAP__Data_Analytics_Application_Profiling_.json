    "description": "The Data Analytics Application Profiling (DAAP) utility is a software program comprised of a library and scripts to provide basic instrumenting of parallel scientific software applications while they are running on an HPC cluster, and transmit this data over a secure connection as individual records to aggregators. When used in conjunction with additional open source software components (Telegraf, FluentD, and RabbitMQ), the data collected by DAAP can be transmitted off-cluster to an analytics system of the user\u2019s choice for further analysis.",
