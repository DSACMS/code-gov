    "description": "The developed code simulates real-time monitor and control for west area of IEEE 118-bus system. The 24-hour load profile for each bus is derived by scaling the system\u2019s rated load in the PSSE sav file according to the California Independent System Operator\u2019s Day-ahead load forecast for May 1, 2024. This simulator performs several critical functions: (1) Calculating time-series power flow every 4 seconds; (2) Updating and dispatching AGC signals every minute; (3) Conducting N-1 contingency analysis every 5 minutes. Additionally, the simulator can trip lines and subsequently update and dispatch AGC signals, running power flow analysis after each tripping event.",
