    "description": "RMEM - a prototyping platform to explore the usage of RMA-based strategies in GPU-to-GPU communication.\nThe implementation relies on libfabric (BSD-2 or GNUv2) to explore different synchronization approach and their associated performance. It is compatible with different network technologies such as InfiniBand, SlingShot-11, and TCP.  It provides to the user host-to-host and device-to-device communication. The latter can be initiated either from the host, or from the device.",
