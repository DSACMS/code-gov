    "description": "MF-LBM is a high-performance lattice Boltzmann code for direct numerical simulation of three-dimensional multiphase flow in porous media. The main features of the code include: 1) implemented with advanced multiphase and wetting models that enable simulation of supercritical CO2 (scCO2) and brine displacement in real rock geometries; 2) extensively optimized for modern SIMD/SIMT processors/co-processors, such as GPU; 3) based on MPI-OpenACC/OpenMP hybrid programing model that enables high portability; 4) overlapped communication and computation that enables high scalability; 5) designed for flow simulations on digital rock images or complex microfluidic devices.",
