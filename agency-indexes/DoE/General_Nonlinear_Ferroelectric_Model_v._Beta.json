    "description": "The purpose of this software is to function as a generalized ferroelectric material model. The material model is designed to work with existing finite element packages by providing updated information on material properties that are nonlinear and dependent on loading history. The two major nonlinear phenomena this model captures are domain-switching and phase transformation. The software itself does not contain potentially sensitive material information and instead provides a framework for different physical phenomena observed within ferroelectric materials. The model is calibrated to a specific ferroelectric material through input parameters provided by the user.",
