    "description": "The SEMS Pipeline Framework Infrastructure (SPiFI) library is a collection of utilities that simplify the development of Continuous Integration (CI) / Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines within the Jenkins testing application.\nThe goal of SPiFI is to provide a layer of convenience functions for common tasks a pipeline developer will need to implement, such as timeouts, automatic retries, dry-run testing, concurrent test launching, results aggregation, and email notifications to accelerate pipeline development.  SPiFI enables the DevOPs engineer to focus more on what their pipeline should do rather than how to implement certain details within the restricted programming environment provided by the Jenkins application.SAND2020-12550 M\n\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
