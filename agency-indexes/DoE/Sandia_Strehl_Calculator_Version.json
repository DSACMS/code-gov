    "description": "The Sandia Strehl Calculator is designed to calculate the Gibson and Lanni point spread function (PSF), Strehl ratio, and ensquared energy, allowing non-design immersion, coverslip, and sample layers. It also uses Abbe number calculations to determine the refractive index at specific wavelengths when given the refractive index at a different wavelength and the dispersion. The theory behind the code is all fully developed in standard optics references. The novelty of the code is packaging it in a format that is accessible to general microscope users, not limited to individuals with expertise in both optics and computer programming.",
