    "description": "Spitfire is a Python and C++ code for solving canonical flame structure problems to build tabulated chemistry models for the simulation of large-scale fires. Spitfire is a modular software with performance critical code written in C++, abstract numerical methods provided in Python, and chemistry tabulation techniques made convenient for high-level use by non-expert users. It facilitates both high-level usage and novel research in tabulated chemistry approaches.
