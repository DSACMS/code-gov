    "description": "In post-crash situations, passengers, bystanders, and first responders are exposed to the immediate safety risks of stranded energy in electric vehicle (EV) batteries. A potentially damaged battery with an unknown state of safety might go into a thermal runaway without proper handling, leading to potential loss of life and property damage. Therefore, it is imperative to develop methods, guidelines and tools to handle the post-crash EVs appropriately and minimize safety risks from immediately after an EV accident to final disposal or re-entry to the road. \nThis software tool:\n(1) provides quick access to EV specification,  \n(2) estimate stranded energy left in an EV after a crash specific to EVs in a user-friendly way, \n(3) inform EV structure/disconnect for appropriate quick post-crash handling,\n(4) perform the calculation for the first responder to decide on onsite or offsite discharge, and\n(5) feature appropriate battery disposal and education/lessons learned.\nThis software tool will directly help the emergency responders to handle EV post-crash situations effectively and safely.",
