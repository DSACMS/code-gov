    "description": "A software framework to study, from the performance and energy perspective, the efficacy of GPU-resident\nparallel Conjugate Gradient (CG) linear solver with different preconditioner options, including Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi, and\nincomplete Cholesky. We also propose a novel GPU-based preconditioner, in which the triangular solves are approximated\nby an iterative process",
