    "description": "Tracktable is designed for analysis and rendering of the trajectories of moving objects such as planes, trains, automobiles and ships. Its purpose is to operate on large sets of trajectories (millions) to help a user detect, analyze and display patterns. It will also be used to disseminate trajectory research results from Sandia's PANTHER Grand Challenge LDRD.",
