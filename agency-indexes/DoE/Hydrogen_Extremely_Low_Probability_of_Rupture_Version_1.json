    "description": "SAND2024-08511O\nThe Hydrogen Extremely Low Probability of Rupture (HELPR) software toolkit provides probabilistic fracture assessments of natural gas infrastructure for transporting hydrogen. Using probabilistic sampling and sensitivity analysis\u2014along with engineering fatigue and fracture mechanics\u2014 the software develops models that can predict structural integrity measures for natural gas pipelines under stress. \nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
