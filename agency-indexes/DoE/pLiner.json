    "description": "Compiler optimizations can alter significantly the numerical results of scientific computing applications.\nWhen numerical results differ significantly between compilers, optimization levels, and floating-point\nhardware, these numerical inconsistencies can impact programming productivity. pLiner is a framework\nthat helps programmers identify locations in the source code that are highly affected by compiler\noptimizations. pLiner uses a novel approach to identify such code locations by enhancing the floatingpoint\nprecision of variables and expressions. Using a guided search to locate the most significant code\nregions, pLiner can report to users such locations at different granularities, file, function, and line of code.",
