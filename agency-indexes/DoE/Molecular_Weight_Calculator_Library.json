    "description": "MwtWinDLL contains utility functions for calculating the molecular weight and percent composition of chemical formulas and amino acids. It recognizes user-definable abbreviations and custom elemental isotopes. It also includes a Mole/Mass Converter, Formula Finder, Capillary Flow Modeller, Amino Acid Notation Converter, Isotopic Distribution Calculator, and Peptide Sequence Fragmentation Modeller. To use, simply include the DLL in a .NET project.",
