    "description": "Machine learning (ML) models often contain numerous hyperparameters, free parameters that must be set before the models can be trained. As the number of model hyperparameters increases, their optimization becomes significantly more challenging as we face a combinatorial increase in potential model configurations. Similarly, there is an increased chance that our models\u2019 hyperparameters interact in complex ways. HyperSpace allows a user to optimize complex machine learning algorithms based on their hyperparameters. HyperSpace works by parallelizing parameter search spaces, running Bayesian model based optimization (SMBO) over each of these spaces in parallel. It was designed to be as minimally invasive as possible such that very little change to existing code will be needed to get a user started.",
