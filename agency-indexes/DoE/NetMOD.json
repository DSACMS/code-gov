    "description": "NetMOD is a tool to model the performance of global ground-based explosion monitoring systems. The initial version of the software supports the simulation of seismic detection capability. The tool provides a user interface to execute simulations based upon a hypothetical definition of the monitoring system configuration, geophysical properties of the Earth, and detection analysis criteria.",
