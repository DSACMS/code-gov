    "description": "IN-SPIRE\u2122 can quickly and automatically convey the gist of large sets of unformatted text documents such as technical reports, web data, newswire feeds and message traffic. By clustering similar documents together, this Windows-based software unveils common themes and reveals hidden relationships within the collection. IN-SPIRE\u2122 allows analysts to spend more time exploring the information they find most relevant and less time sifting through the masses of irrelevant documents.",
