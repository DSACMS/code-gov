    "description": "SAND2023-05107O\nJuliaOceanWaves is a collection of packages and functions for modeling wave energy converters. The open-source software is designed to be used by the wave energy community to model new concepts, perform design optimization, and more.\nCapabilities include: \n\u2022\tA representation of ocean wave spectra and input/output (e.g. read from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration buoys) and post-processing functionalities; \n\u2022\tA solver for the linear potential flow radiation and diffraction equations for wave forcing on floating structures. \n\u2022\tSolving the floating body linear dynamics in the frequency domain. \nFuture additions to the software will include solving non-linear floating body dynamics in the time-domain through time-marching Ordinary Differential Equation solvers and the pseudo-spectral optimization method.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
