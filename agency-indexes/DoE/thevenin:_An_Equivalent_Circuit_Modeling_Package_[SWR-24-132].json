    "description": "This package is a wrapper for the well-known Thevenin equivalent circuit model for simulating battery behavior with a focus on ease of use. The model is comprised of a single series resistor followed by any number of parallel RC pairs. \n\nThe package includes an intuitive \"experiment\" interface, which simplifies the programming of constant or dynamic current, voltage, and/or power-driven loads, making it ideal for a wide range of applications, from basic tests to complex simulations. It also supports state-of-charge (SOC) and temperature-dependent properties, allowing the model to be more easily calibrated against real cells.",
