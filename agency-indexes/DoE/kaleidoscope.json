    "description": "kaleidoscope is an R package developed to visualize PLEXOS scenarios as packaged by the rplexos R package. The package provides three types of visualizations intended to be used as coordinated views: a geographic diagram, a chord diagram, and dispatch charts. The geographic diagram provides a qualitative view of the study domain representing individual generator output and interregional transmission flows. The chord diagrams provide a more quantitative view of the net interchange between each of the regions. The dispatch charts are stacked and grouped bar charts providing an instantaneous snapshot of the generation mix by ISO and scenario.\n",
