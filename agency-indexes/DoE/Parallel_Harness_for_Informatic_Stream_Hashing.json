    "description": "PHISH is a lightweight framework which a set of independent processes can use to exchange data as they run on the same desktop machine, on processors of a parallel machine, or on different machines across a network. This enables them to work in a coordinated parallel fashion to perform computations on either streaming, archived, or self-generated data. The PHISH distribution includes a simple, portable library for performing data exchanges in useful patterns either via MPI message-passing or ZMQ sockets. PHISH input scripts are used to describe a data-processing algorithm, and additional tools provided in the PHISH distribution convert the script into a form that can be launched as a parallel job.",
