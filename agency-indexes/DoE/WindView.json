    "description": "The National Renewable Energy Laboratory, NREL and Argonne National Laboratory, ANL are creating an open-source situational awareness and decision support platform called WindView that provides grid operators with knowledge on the state and performance of wind power on their system. University Texas Dallas is contracted by NREL to create a wind power forecaster that will be integrated into WindView. WindView does not provide any data, it is a visualization platform which requires the user to provide their own data. During the three year project, there has been collaboration with industry through technical review committees and specifically the Western Area Power Authority's, WAPA's Energy Training Power Center, EPTC to develop a production-level version of WindView which will work for industry. Once complete, it will be publicly available for industry and academic researchers.",
