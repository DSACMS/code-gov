    "description": "TOUGHREACT V3.32 is a 3-D reactive transport code that handles to non-isothermal, multiphase/multicomponent fluid flow, heat transport, aqueous and gaseous species advection-diffusion, and equilibrium/kinetic water-gas-rock-biological reactions. TOUGHREACT V3.32 is based on TOUGHREACT V3.0-OMP, with several new features including temperature and species-dependent aqueous species diffusion coefficients, addition of the EWASG EOS module, a new generalized Monod kinetics function, time-dependent pressure-temperature boundary conditions, new VisIt-compatible tecplot-format output files (with new flux and velocity vector component outputs), new input and output options, and improved global water mass balance and coupling between flow, transport and reactive chemistry.",
