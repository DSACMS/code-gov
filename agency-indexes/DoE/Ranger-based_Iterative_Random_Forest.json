    "description": "Iterative Random Forest (iRF) is an improvement upon the classic Random Forest, using weighted iterations to distill the forests. Ranger is a C++ implementation of random forest or recursive partitioning, particularly suited for high dimensional data. Ranger-Based iRF uses Ranger as a base Random Forest codebase upon which iterative and scalability aspects have been added.",
