    "description": "Direct-Sampling Beam Position Monitor is an FPGA gateware and embedded firmware that run on evaluation kits (either Xilinx ZCU111 or Xilinx ZCU208 ) that digitizes signals up to 4GSPS and 4GHz analog bandwidth, which can be synchronized to the accelerator timing system, providing synchronous sampling frequency/phase digitization. In addition to these capabilities, a proof of concept for a beam position monitor is also present, providing an envelope detection algorithm capable of determining the transverse beam position for an electron circular accelerator, such as ALS/ALS-U.",
