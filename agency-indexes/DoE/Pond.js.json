    "description": "Pond.js is a library built on top of immutable.js and Typescript to provide time-based data structures, serialization and processing. For data structures it unifies the use of times, time ranges, events, collections and time series. For processing it provides a chained pipeline interface to aggregate, collect and process batches or streams of events. ",
