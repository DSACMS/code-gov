    "description": "This software provides a fast way to perform efficient sparse matrix multiplication followed by top-n multiplication result selection. Functionality for performing matrix multiplication / cosine similarity separately is included in this package as well. This package is a pure Go port of a Python package developed by ING Bank (https://github.com/ing-bank/sparse_dot_topn) which uses Cython to execute the matrix multiplication in C++. Instructions for compiling bindings which can be called from Python are included with this package as well.",
