    "description": "This software is intended to facilitate the sending of data from DeepLynx to some human machine interface (HMI). The HMI would read the data generated by this software and potentially make a physical change on a process which the HMI controls. This software enables a digital twin using DeepLynx to talk to an HMI, thereby making autonomous updates to the physical asset which is being twinned.",
