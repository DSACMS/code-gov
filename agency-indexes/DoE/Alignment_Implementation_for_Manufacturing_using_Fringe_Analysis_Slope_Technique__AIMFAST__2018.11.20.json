    "description": "AIMFAST is a software code used to align facets on a dish or heliostat solar concentrator to a specific aimpoint strategy to minimize peak fluxes and maximize system optical performance. AIMFAST uses a large monitor or projection screen to display fringe patterns, and a machine vision camera to image the reflection of these patterns in the subject dish mirrors. From these images, a detailed map of surface normals can be generated and compared to design or fitted mirror shapes. This fitted comparison is then used to develop a single vector representing the orientation of the facets relative to the design orientation and provide near-real-time adjustment information to a communicating computer. The communicating computer can display adjustments or directly interface with adjustment tools. ",
