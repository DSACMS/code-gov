    "description": "Software that employs an algorithm that rapidly and rigorously solves nonnegative least squares problems with many right hand sides. This is the latest internal version of MATLAB pseudocode that was described in a published in M. H. Van Benthem and M. R. Keenan, \"Fast algorithm for the solution of largescale non-negativity-constrained least squares problems,\" J. Chemom. 18(10), 441-450 (2004). Example code of this algorithm was included in the publication. This algorithm was also patented in M. H. Van Benthem and M. R. Keenan, \"Fast combinatorial algorithm for the solution of linearly constrained least squares problems,\"USPTO, Ed., Sandia Corporation, USA (2008).
