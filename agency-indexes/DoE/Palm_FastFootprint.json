    "description": "Palm/FastFootprints implements two method for rapid memory footprint access diagnostics. The two methods are whole program and precise. Current footprint analyses can cause 200\u00d7 or more slowdown with realistic inputs and are therefore impractical. The whole-program method reduces the overhead to 10% by computing upper bounds, but still yields interprocedural insight through a call path profile. Our precise method uses additional static analysis and profiling to refine the upper bounds for intra-procedural loop nests.",
