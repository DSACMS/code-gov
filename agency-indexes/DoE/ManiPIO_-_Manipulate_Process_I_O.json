    "description": "SAND2021-15053 O ManiPIO is a Python-based tool used to test Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), Industrial Control Systems (ICS), and ICS networks. It reads an input script to construct complex Events on ICS networks and uses the ModBus communication standard to communicate. Users can use ManiPIO to construct complex timelines of ICS communication events to simulate any number of network-based scenarios.
