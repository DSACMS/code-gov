    "description": "a new release of the software tool that includes newly developed algorithms housed along\npreviously released ones within a single user interface.\nThe new functionalities are:\nCCS raw data converter (iEdison No. 0685901-23-0100), IPID 32762-E.\nIM-MS-DDA converter and data format (iEdison No. 0685901-23-0099), IPID 32761-E.\nThe previously developed functionalities are:\nPNNL-PreProcessor, IPID 31727-E.\n2DLC-MS to LC-IM-MS data file converter, IPID 32136-E.\nIMS data file transformations, IPID 32137-E.\nRemarks about the PNNL-PreProcessor:\nDirectly reads Agilent MassHunter (.d) data files and generates new Agilent MassHunter (.d) data files with\nenhanced raw signal quality and/or transformed data. Can also process UIMF files.\nHas both command-line and graphical user interfaces.\nPNNL provides the software executable, freely available for download (https://pnnl-comp-massspec.github.io/PNNL-PreProcessor) and it can be utilized by Agilent customers for non-commercial use.\nThe source code is not publicly available, an internal source code repository is maintained at PNNL",
