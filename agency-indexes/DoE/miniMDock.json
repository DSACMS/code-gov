    "description": "A molecular docking mini-app, GPU-accelerated particle-grid based protein ligand docking programs  that can be used for virtual drug discovery compound screens based on a molecular recognition model, that analysis a three-dimensional model of an interaction between a protein and a small molecule (ligand). The miniMDock is developed using multiple programming models/APIs and can be used to evaluate performance portability of molecular docking applications over different heterogeneous systems.",
