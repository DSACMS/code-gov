    "description": "PelePhysics is a suite of physics packages that provides functionality of use to reacting hydrodynamics CFD codes. The initial release includes an interface to reaction rate mechanism evaluation, transport coefficient evaluation, and a generalized equation of state (EOS) facility. Both generic evaluators and interfaces to code from externally available tools (Fuego for chemical rates, EGLib for transport coefficients) are provided.",
