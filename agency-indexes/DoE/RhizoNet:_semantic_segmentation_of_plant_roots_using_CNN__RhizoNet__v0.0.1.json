    "description": "RhizoNet is designed for the semantic segmentation of plant root scans, utilizing a sophisticated deep learning network known as Residual Unet. It specializes in processing color images of plants cultivated in a hydroponic EcoFAB system, captured using an Epson scanner. The core of the algorithm is based on Residual U-nets, which significantly improve prediction accuracy. This is achieved through the implementation of a convex hull operation, which effectively delineates the primary root component by leveraging spatio-temporal image data. This enables researchers to accurately assess predicted biomass and monitor plant growth over time.",
