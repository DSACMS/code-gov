    "description": "Portably Performant Physical Algebra (P3A) is a C++ library that provides classes representing variables in a physical algebra equation. These equations are the fundamental way that physics models are written (\"f = ma\" for example). P3A provides a way to write in the C++ programming language similar to how one would do math on paper. P3A provides support tools for rapidly solving equations in a way that is common in scientific computing. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.
