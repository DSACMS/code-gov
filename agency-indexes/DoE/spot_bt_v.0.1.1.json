    "description": "SAND2024-08430O\nspot_bt allows users to easily construct complex, autonomous behaviors without having to overly rely on Boston Dynamic\u2019s Spot robot software development kit. Using a form-of-state machine called a \"behavior tree,\" the software develops and applies different \"leaves\" or actions to the robot. Attaching multiple actions in sequence creates a \"branch,\" and a series of these make up the \"tree.\" The software works on any x86 or aarch64 hardware but must run on a Linux OS. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525",
