    "description": "DaCe is a parallel programming framework that takes code in Python/NumPy and other programming languages, and maps it to high-performance CPU, GPU, and FPGA programs, which can be optimized to achieve state-of-the-art. Internally, DaCe uses the Stateful DataFlow multiGraph (SDFG) data-centric intermediate representation: A transformable, interactive representation of code based on data movement. Since the input code and the SDFG are separate, it is possible to optimize a program without changing its source, so that it stays readable. On the other hand, transformations are customizable and user-extensible, so they can be written once and reused in many applications. With data-centric parallel programming, we enable direct knowledge transfer of performance optimization, regardless of the application or the target processor.",
