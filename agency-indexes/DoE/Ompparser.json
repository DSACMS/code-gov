    "description": "ompparser is a standalone and unified OpenMP parser, which is motivated by the facts that:\n\n1) The differences in terms of syntax and semantics of OpenMP constructs between C/C++ and Fortran\nare minor.\n\n2) Current OpenMP compilers often develop their own parsers, which represent redundant work.\n\nThe features of ompparser include:\n\n1) ompparser can be used standalone for static source code analysis, e.g. tools for semantics checking or similarity analysis between C/C++ and Fortran programs\n\n2) omppaser can be integrated into an OpenMP compiler implementation can reduce the development efforts, and there is no need to create and maintain two separate parsers for C/C++ and Fortran.\n\n3) ompparser provides a complete reference OpenMP grammar in the Backus-Naur Form that formally describes all the latest OpenMP language constructs.\n\nThis will help users understand the rules and restriction of the OpenMP standard, which no longer contains a reference grammar in its recent versions.\n",
