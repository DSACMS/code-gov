    "description": "This is an announcement service for JupyterHub that JupyterHub admins can manage through a JupyterHub-styled UI. JupyterHub administrators can use it to communicate with their hub's users about status, upcoming outages, or share news. It allows admins to post a current announcement, and show previous announcements in reverse chronological order. It provides a REST API hook that admins can use to post the latest announcement on JupyterHub itself (with custom templates).",
