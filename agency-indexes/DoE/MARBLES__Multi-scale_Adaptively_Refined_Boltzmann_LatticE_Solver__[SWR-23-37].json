    "description": "MARBLES (Multi-scale Adaptively Refined Boltzmann LatticE Solver) is an open-source computational fluid dynamics package powered by the lattice Boltzmann equations and built on AMReX. In the lattice Boltzmann method, local collisions between meso-scale fictitious particles drive the governing equations which enables MARBLES to easily simulate flow around complex and/or moving geometry without the generation of a body-conforming mesh. Using AMReX data structures and operations ensures a high level of computational performance and parallel scaling on heterogenous architectures while also naturally supporting locally enhanced grid resolution and fidelity through automatic mesh refinement. New domains and problem definitions are easily specified through an input file with examples and guidance on all options and variables provided in the MARBLES documentation.",
