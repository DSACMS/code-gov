    "description": "The PyEPANET package is a set of commands for the Python programming language that are built to wrap the EPANET toolkit library commands, without requiring the end user to program using the ctypes package. This package does not contain the \nEPANET code, nor does it implement the functions within the EPANET software, and it requires the separately downloaded or compiled EPANET2 toolkit dynamic library (epanet.dll, libepanet.so, or epanet.dylib) and/or the EPANET-MSX dynamic library in order to function. \n\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
