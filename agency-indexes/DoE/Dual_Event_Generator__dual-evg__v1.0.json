    "description": "The dual event generator is a event-based timing system implementation capable of synchronizing (with respect to clock, events and triggers) hundreds of downstreams devices. This has been in use by ALS for many years and this is a similar implementation, but with a synchronized dual-master frequency , as opposed to just one in a more conventional approach.",
