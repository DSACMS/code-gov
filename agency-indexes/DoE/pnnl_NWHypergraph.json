    "description": "NWHypergraph is a C++ hypergraph processing framework for shared-memory architecture. NWHypergraph provides\nefficient algorithms to construct s-line graphs, a lower-order approximation of a given hypergraph, and computes different\ngraph metrics of a s-line graph such as s-connected components, s-betweenness centrality, s-closeness centrality, etc. It\nalso provides Python APIs for s-line graph computation. The Python APIs are provided using Pybind11",
