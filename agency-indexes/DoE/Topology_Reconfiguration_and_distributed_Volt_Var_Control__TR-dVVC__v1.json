    "description": "Topology Reconfiguation is a simple algorithm to choose a network configuration with the least losses in a system with high penetration of renewable energy. It uses a linearized optimal power flow algorithm to identify the optimal setpoints of PV in a system, then performs an exhaustive search of switch configurations to find the loss minimizing solution, it repeats this process until convergence. At the end, the operator has a switch schedule for a 24 hour period that should minimize losses. VVC is a distributed algorithm in which PV units drive voltage at points within the network to 1 per unit through reactive power control. The VVC algorithm relies on extremum seeking control to provide the control. The software package is a simulation of VVC on a standard IEEE 34 bus three phase network.",
