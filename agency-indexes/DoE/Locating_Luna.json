    "description": "Locating Luna is a STEM Education virtual reality game for grade 6-12 students. Users search for a lost dog in a dark swamp, calling out to the dog and lighting torches as they search. The app collects data on all user actions which are saved in a file for download. Teachers then have students use various tools to represent and analyze their data. This provides a common interactive experience for teachers to use in addressing computer science learning standards.  Locations of key points of interest in the app (such as the dog) are randomly generated when the game is restarted\u037e however, replay without a restart of the game allows users to try the same scenario again with a different search strategy. This allows users to compare strategies using data. A teacher's guide supports use by teachers in the classroom.",
