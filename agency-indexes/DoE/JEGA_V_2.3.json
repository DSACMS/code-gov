    "description": "JEGA is a software package that implements a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) for solution to multi-objective optimization problems (MOPS) and a single objective genetic algorithm (SOGA) for solution to single objective optimization problems (SOPS).  JEGA is highly configurable and provides a rich set of algorithmic components for tailored optimization.  It has been used successfully on many problems by users both internal and external to Sandia.  By employing object-oriented design to implement abstractions of the key components making up the algorithms, JEGA provides a flexible and extensible problem-solving environment for design and performance analysis of computational models.",
