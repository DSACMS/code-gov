    "description": "The Cyber-Informed Engineering Microgrid Analysis Tool (CIEMAT) leverages the Department of Energy\u2019s Cyber-Informed Engineering to prompt engineering designers and operators through an analysis of the critical functions to be supported by a microgrid installations, the criticality of those functions, the impacts of denial, disruption or misuse of those functions on the microgrid and dependent functions, and the mitigations which could best prevent impacts to those functions resulting from cyber attack. Through use of this tool, microgrid designers and operators can quickly identify appropriate engineering mitigations to limit impacts from cyber attack and functions where engineering and operational staff can prioritize and guide the application of cybersecurity protections to best support the resiliency of the system.",
