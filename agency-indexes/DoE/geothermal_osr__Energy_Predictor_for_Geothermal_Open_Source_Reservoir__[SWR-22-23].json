    "description": "This is a repository with the tools developed for predicting energy produced at Open-Source Reservoir (OSR). It includes both simulation data for OSR, as well as Jupyter notebooks for training and evaluating prediction models. OSR was constructed based on the data from Brady Hot Springs reservoir (Nevada, USA) but has a number of sufficiently modified characteristics and does not disclose any sensitive data.",
