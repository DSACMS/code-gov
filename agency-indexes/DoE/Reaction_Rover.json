    "description": "Reaction Rover is a software application designed to enable reaction optimization with little or no human intervention and to provide a flexible platform to facilitate rapid testing, automation, and implementation of new reaction optimization algorithms. Toward these goals, Reaction Rover is designed to be modular, allowing the optimization algorithm, analyzer, and reactor components to be changed for any given process using easily integrated plugins. The Reaction Rover platform is a key development that enables the testing, use, and automation of machine learning (ML) and non-ML optimizers in a variety of laboratory situations.",
