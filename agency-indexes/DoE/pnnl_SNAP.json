    "description": "In this work, we detail two uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods that provide complementary information. Readout\nensembling, by finetuning only the readout layers of an ensemble of foundation models, provides information about model\nuncertainty. Amending the final readout layer to predict upper and lower quantiles replaces point predictions with\ndistributional predictions, which provide information about uncertainty within the underlying training data. We\ndemonstrate our approach with the MACE-MP-0 model, applying UQ to both the foundation model and a series of finetuned\nmodels. The uncertainties produced by the ensemble and quantile methods are demonstrated to be distinct measures by\nwhich the quality of the NNP output can be judged.",
