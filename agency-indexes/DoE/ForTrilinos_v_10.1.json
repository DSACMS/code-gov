    "description": "ForTrilinos stands for interfaces to Trilinos. It effectively replaces common practices for interfacing Fortran codes with Trilinos C++ packages. Common practices include writing user-specific drivers and exploiting the name-mangling schemes of specific compilers. ForTrilinos improves portability and robustness by exploiting the C interoperability constructs of Fortran 2003. These constructs facilitate binding Fortran interface bodies to their equivalent C function prototypes, providing for name resolution independent of the compiler\u2122s underlying mangling scheme and guaranteeing compatible type bit representations. Furthermore, ForTrilinos maintains the overall design philosophy and architecture of Trilinos by creating a derived type structure in Fortran similar to the class hierarchy in the underlying C++.ForTrilinos can be applied wherever the underlying Trilinos packages can be applied.",
