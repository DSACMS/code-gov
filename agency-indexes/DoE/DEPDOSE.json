    "description": "DEPDOSE is an open-source computer application which combines the KDEP respiratory tract deposition software with committed equivalent dose coefficient tables from the DC_PAK internal dosimetry package. DEPDOSE allows the user to rapidly produce tables of dose coefficients to workers and members of the public inhaling a precisely defined, user-specified aerosols using the ICRP 60 series methodology. Combined with a plume dispersion modeling system such as QUIC, this makes it possible to predict radiation doses downstream from an accidental or intentional release of radioactive materials. For this work, a radioactive plume was calculated to members of the public downstream from a plausible release of radionuclides into the atmosphere.",
