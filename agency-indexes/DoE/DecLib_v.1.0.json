    "description": "SAND2025-00852O\nDecLib is a software library that aids in the study and application of discrete exterior calculus (DEC) in physical systems. It offers a range of models in fluid and solid mechanics that help users understand complex dynamics like shallow water and compressible Euler equations. DecLib preserves the inherent structures of these systems to ensure accurate and reliable simulations. It is a user-friendly application for exploring geometric mechanics and enhancing the study of physical phenomena. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
