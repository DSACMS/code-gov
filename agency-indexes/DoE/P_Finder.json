    "description": "P Finder is written in C# and has been tested in multiple 64-bit Windows environments (Windows 7/8/Vista). It has a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that allows for intuitive RNase P RNA identification and/or annotation. The user can select from four search criteria including the use multiple threads. In addition, the user can determine what display data they wish to incorporate in the output such as: bitscore, E-value, percent ID, start location, end location, the strand in which the sequence is located, and of course the sequence itself. P Finder is the only available algorithm that is capable of not only identifying the RNase P RNA for annotation but also differentiating among the five different RNase P RNA structural types (A, B, C, M, and T) with the option to select these data types for display in the final output.",
