    "description": "C20129 CoSyR is a unique particle beam dynamics simulation code developed using MPI + Kokkos on multi-GPU platforms. This new simulation code tackles a fundamental problem of the nonlinear dynamics of a particle beam from its complete self-fields, particularly the radiation fields, which underpins many accelerator design issues in high brightness beam applications as well as those arising in the development of advanced accelerators.",
