    "description": "GIO is an application programmer interface (API) or library for high performance IO that is designed for climate models that operate on a geodesic grid. GIO uses a combination of configuration files and API calls to define the mapping of internal model data to output variables in standard climate data formats. The mapping from model data to model output includes method of data slicing, aggregation, and linearization using a morton ordering approach. The data is then persisted through a standard interface that can be implemented using several different high level parallel libraries. Both Parallel NetCDF and NetCDF4 interfaces are provided. GIO is designed to run on supercomputing systems or multi-processor clusters with parallel file systems.",
