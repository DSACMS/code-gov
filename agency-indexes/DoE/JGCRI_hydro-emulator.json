    "description": "The hydrological emulator (HE) was built to mimic complex global hydrological models (GHMs) at a range of spatial scales. The HE was written in MATLAB and utilizes a genetic algorithm to calibrate the a, b, c, d, m parameters from the ABCD runoff algorithm to observed runoff from GHMs when forced by the same climate data. The HE employs two methods to choose from when processing basin data: lumped (by basin) and distributed (gridded). Both methods can be evaluated using the built-in Kling-Gupta efficiency as a measure of model performance when compared to the outputs from the more complex GHM. Testing shows that the HE is 7 orders of magnitude faster then the widely used Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) GHM.",
