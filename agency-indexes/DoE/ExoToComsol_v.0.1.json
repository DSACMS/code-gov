    "description": "SAND2024-08641O\nExoToComsol models capability-sharing. For example, the software can develop a multiphysics modeling chain using physics modeling capabilities from different research institutions using either SIERRA or COMSOL. The converter program allows exporting user-defined, region-of-interest from a large FE model, which results in a finer mesh of the submodel that can be used for subsequent analysis. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
