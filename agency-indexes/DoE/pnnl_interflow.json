    "description": "A Python package for organizing and calculating cross-sectoral interdependency flow values. The interflow package collects known resource flow values (e.g., water demand) between sectors provided by the user and calculates new sector flows for a secondary resource type (e.g., energy demand) based on provided resource intensity estimates, source sector fractions, and downstream sector discharge fractions.",
