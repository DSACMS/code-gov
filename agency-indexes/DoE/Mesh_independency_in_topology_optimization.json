    "description": "The topology optimization community has regularly employed optimization algorithms from the operations research community. However, these algorithms are implemented in the sequence space l2 instead of the\nproper function space where the design variable resides. In this software, we benchmark the mesh independent implementation of pyMMAopt with three common problems in topology optimization. We show how the volume fraction variable discretization on non-uniform meshes affects the convergence of\nl2 based optimization algorithms and how pyMMAopt successfully achieves mesh independent convergence.",
