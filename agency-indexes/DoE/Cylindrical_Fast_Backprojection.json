    "description": "Cylindrical Fast Backprojection (CFBP) is a novel image reconstruction algorithm developed at PNNL that radically\nincreases the efficiency of normal backprojection techniques and is ideally suited to microwave and millimeter-wave\nimaging systems based on scanned linear arrays such as current and next-generation cylindrical body scanners in\ncommon use for aviation security screening.
