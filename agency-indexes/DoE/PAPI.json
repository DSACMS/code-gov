    "description": "The Performance Application Programming Interface (PAPI) provides tool designers and application engineers with a consistent interface and methodology for the use of low-level performance counter hardware found across the entire compute system (i.e. CPUs, GPUs, on/off-chip memory, interconnects, I/O system, energy/power, etc.). PAPI enables users to see, in near real time, the relations between software performance and hardware events across the entire computer system.",
