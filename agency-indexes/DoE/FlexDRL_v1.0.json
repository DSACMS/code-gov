    "description": "FlexDRL is a framework that can be used as a benchmarking tool to evaluate different Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms in a building energy management setting. OpenAI Gym was used as wrapper to the co-simulation environment (EnergyPlus for envelope and HVAC and Modelica for battery and PV) to interface with DRL algorithms, which are developed in PyTorch. In order to facilitate the usage of FlexDRL, all the required dependencies have been packaged into a Docker container.",
