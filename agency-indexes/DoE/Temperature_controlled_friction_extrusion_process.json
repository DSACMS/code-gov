    "description": "Processing temperature is decisive to the properties and performance of the product in friction extrusion. However, the constantly varying thermal boundary conditions result in an unstable processing temperature even fixed die rotational speed and feed rate were implemented, which extensively disturb the stability of the process and the quality of the\nproduct. It is key to maintain the process temperature to ensure the properties of the product is uniform. What's more, a controlled processing temperature enables the properties of the product to be manipulatable between parts and between\ndifferent locations of one part",
