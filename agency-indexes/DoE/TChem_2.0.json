    "description": "The TChem toolkit is an object-oriented C++ software library that enables numerical simulations using complex chemistry and facilitates the analysis of detailed kinetic models. The toolkit provides capabilities for thermodynamic properties and gas-phase and surface chemistry. The computations rely on the Kokkos framework for parallel execution on many-core and GPU-based platforms. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.
