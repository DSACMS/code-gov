    "description": "Problem Solved: A novel technique for regression and sensitivity analysis of C1 function f problematic input dimension given observations (x_i, f(x_i), f'(x_i)). Solution Provided by the Code: Active Manifolds reduces the problem to analysis/regression of a 1 dimensional analogue by exploiting geometric properties of the function.",
