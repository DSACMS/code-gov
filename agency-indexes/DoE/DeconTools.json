    "description": "DeconTools is a software package used for detecting features in MS data by using the isotopic signatures of expected components. The tool uses different algorithms for different parts of the deconvolution process: noise reduction, peak detection, prediction of theoretical isotopic envelope and scoring functions that quantitate the quality of signature observed in the data.",
