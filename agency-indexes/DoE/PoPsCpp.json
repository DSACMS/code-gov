    "description": "A new format for storing particle information (i.e., mass, spin, parity) has been developed. \n\nThe format is a subset of the Generalized Nuclear Data Structure (GNDS) developed for storing nuclear reaction data. \n\nA C++ library dubbed \"Property of Particles\" (PoPs) has been developed to read particle data in the GNDS\nformat. \n\nThe PoPs library provides functions for reading in a GNDS particle database as well as for accessing a particle and its properties.",
