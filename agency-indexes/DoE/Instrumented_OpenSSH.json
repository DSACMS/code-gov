    "description": "The security group at NERSC recently undertook a project to gain access to this information from user ssh logins. Our solution was to modify the SSH daemon to export information about user names, authentication, keystrokes, file transfers, remote command execution and a variety of SSH related metadata in as agnostic a way as possible. In addition to improved system auditing, we added the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Performance improvement patches as well.",
