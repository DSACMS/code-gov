Hydraulically-vulnerable trees survive on deep-water access in a tropical forest community. To be submitted\u201d. These scripts are divided into two parts: the first set of scripts prepare files for running and processing simulations from the model, Energy Exascale Earth System Land Model-Functionally Assembled Advanced Terrestrial simulator (ELM-FATES) to obtain soil water availability by depth at BCI, Panama, and the second set of scripts are associated with all the analyses related to the inverse modeling for tree rooting depths at BCI.
