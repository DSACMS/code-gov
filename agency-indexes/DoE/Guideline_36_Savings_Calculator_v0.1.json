    "description": "This software package contains a simple calculator that can be used to estimate savings from implementing a retrofit of HVAC controls to ASHRAE Guideline 36 in a multi-zone office building. Implemented in Excel, the calculator has a user-interface front-end to configure parameters of the case study, such as location, building size, and existing control strategies, and a back-end containing results from a large number of pre-run annual energy simulations. The software package also contains the simulation models and associated pre- and post-processing scripts to generate these results.",
