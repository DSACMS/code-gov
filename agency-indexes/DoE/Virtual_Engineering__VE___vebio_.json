    "description": "The Virtual Engineering (VE, vebio) project provides a set of Python modules to enable users to connect mathematical models of unit operations to predict outcomes for an entire chemical process. This VE approach is currently being developed to support the beginning-to-end simulation of the low-temperature conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to a fuel precursor, but the underlying communication functions can be readily extended to connect models from other domains. The models and features currently included in the VE library include a models/simulations for pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and aerobic bioreaction.",
