    "description": "system2atoms is a suite of models that can simulate the performance of hydrogen\ninfrastructure across multiple scales. Examples of the different scale levels include:\n1. System Scale - techno-economic analysis for hydrogen applications,\nintegration of hydrogen infrastructure with the electrical grid,\nand supply and demand constraints across applications\n2. Component Scale - continuous-flow catalyst beds, electrochemical conversion\nunits, gas-phase separators, pumps, compressors, storage tanks, evaporators,\nheaters, and coolers\n3. Material Scale - surface reactions, degradation mechanisms, and catalyst\npoisoning",
