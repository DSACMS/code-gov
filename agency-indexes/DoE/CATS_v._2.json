    "description": "This program calculates performance characteristics for a split flow recompression closed Brayton cycle. The user defines for the cycle; minimum temperature, minimum pressure, maximum temperature, maximum pressure, pinch temperature at the cold ends of the low temperature and high temperature recuperators, component fractional pressure drop, and efficiencies for each of the two turbines and each of the two compressors.  All of these parameters except component fractional pressure drop and turbomachinery efficiencies are varies in separate  do  loops.  In this way, minimum and maximum values for each of these parameters can be set.  Results from each iteration are saved to a .csv file.  Following completion of the program run, the .csv file can be read into a plotting package and the results can be plotted.",
