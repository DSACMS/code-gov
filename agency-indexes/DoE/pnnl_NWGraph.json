    "description": "NWGraph aims to fill the role of a reusable library of generic graph algorithms for C++,\nsimilar to the algorithms available in the standard template library (STL) in C++.\nThe library draws lessons learned from Boost Graph Library (BGL) and other libraries (PBGL,\nGalois, Gunrock, GraphX etc.), the evolution of the C++ language, and the evolution of C++\npractice over the last 20 years.",
