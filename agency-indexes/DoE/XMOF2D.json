    "description": "XMOF2D is a library implementing the X-MOF (eXtended Moments of Fluid) interface reconstruction method on unstructured polygonal meshes with convex cells. Given a computational mesh with multi-material cells, for which volume fractions and centroids of contained materials are provided, piecewise linear material interfaces are constructed inside such cells using the Moment-of-Fluid (MOF) method. Additionally, a hierarchical mesh is created, where every multi-material cell of the computational mesh contains a local mesh with fully established local topology, as well as the parentage information to relate mesh entities from the local and the computational \nmeshes.",
