    "description": "The Fourier-Bessel Particle-In-Cell code is a scientific simulation software for relativistic plasma physics. It is a Particle-In-Cell code whose distinctive feature is to use a spectral decomposition in cylindrical geometry.\r\n\r\nThis decomposition allows to combine the advantages of spectral 3D Cartesian PIC codes (high accuracy and stability) and those of finite-difference cylindrical PIC codes with azimuthal decomposition (orders-of-magnitude speedup when compared to 3D simulations).\r\n\r\nThe code is built on Python and can run both on CPU and GPU (the GPU runs being typically 1 or 2 orders of magnitude faster than the corresponding CPU runs.)\r\n\r\nThe code has the exact same output format as the open-source PIC codes Warp and PIConGPU (openPMD format: openpmd.org) and has a very similar input format as Warp (Python script with many similarities). There is therefore tight interoperability between Warp and FBPIC, and this interoperability will increase even more in the future.",
