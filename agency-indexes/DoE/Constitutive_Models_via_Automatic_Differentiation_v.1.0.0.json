    "description": "SAND2024-00905O\nConstitutive Models via Automatic Differentiation (CMAD) provides a software framework for solving constitutive or material model calibration problems. It relies on JAX's automatic differentiation capabilities to compute the derivatives needed for both forward and adjoint sensitivity analyses. The software can be used to implement constitutive models and calibrate the parameters from experimental data. \nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
