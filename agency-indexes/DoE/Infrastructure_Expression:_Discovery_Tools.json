    "description": "The Infrastructure Expression: Discovery Tools is a toolset that allows for the automated collection of various network, hardware, and software vulnerabilities and details to be collected from systems on a given network. These details are then converted into a STIX 2.1 format, allowing for easy viewing in existing applications as well as sharing and interfacing with tools that already use the STIX 2.1 format.",
