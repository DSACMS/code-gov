    "description": "Supervised machine learning is the process of using past experience to predict the future. \"Ensembles\" are a machine-learning meta-method that can be applied to most machine learning algorithms. Ensembles generally greatly improve accuracy, reduce or remove most of the design issues presented by machine learning, and are admirably suited to parallel and distributed computation. The Avatar Tools codes are an implementation of ensembles specifically for decision trees. Some features that distinguish Avatar Tools from other \"ensembles for decision trees\" codes are: (1) Does the bookkeeping necessary for out of bag (OOB) validation. (2) Can use OOB validation to automatically determine optimal ensemble size. (3) Provides an MPI-based parallel implementation, for distributed operation. (4) Provides convenient tools for cross-validation, to assess the accuracy provided by a training set.
