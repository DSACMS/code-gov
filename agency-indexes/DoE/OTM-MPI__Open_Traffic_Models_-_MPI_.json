    "description": "This software is an extension to OTM (Open Traffic Models), which is an open-source traffic simulator maintained at the Institute of Transportation Studies at U.C. Berkeley. OTM-MPI provides functionality for running OTM simulations in distributed computing environments. Its functionality includes min-cut division of traffic networks (using METIS), deployment of sub-networks on multiple compute nodes, and inter-node MPI communications.",
