    "description": "This software is a Python package designed to act as an interface between FEniCS and PETSc to facilitate the construction and application of parallel block solvers/preconditioners. The original intent of this software was to help enable Battery and Wind Farm simulations for use on high performance computing systems. The code is written in Python and uses the petsc4py module to access the more advance features of the PETSc Krylov Solver. In essence, pFibs is an interface to make accessing these features more streamlined. Additionally, pFibs also provides a template for building custom Python based preconditioning algorithms. ",
