    "description": "The MicroEleX code package contains a variety of models and algorithms for physical modeling of microelectronic circuitry, including electrostatics, electrodynamics, superconducting physics, micromagnetics, multi-ferroic systems, and quantum transport. MicroEleX leverages the AMReX software framework to provide scalability on GPU-based supercomputing architectures. The code is open source and designed to be algorithmically flexible so developers can incorporate enhanced or customized physics.",
