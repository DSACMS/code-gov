    "description": "The plpdfa software is a product of an LDRD project at LLNL entitked \"Adaptive Sampling for Very High Throughput Data Streams\" (tracking number 11-ERD-035). This software was developed by a graduate student summer intern, Chris Challis, who worked under project PI Dan Merl furing the summer of 2011. The software the source code is implementing is a statistical analysis technique for clustering and classification of text-valued data. The method had been previously published by the PI in the open literature.",
