    "description": "LBC encompasses the source code and data to reproduce and extend results for a manuscript that compares demand responsive control schemes for multi-zone buildings. It includes examples of model predictive control (MPC), value function approximation via CVXPYLAYERS, and differentiable predictive control (DPC). The goal of the study is to evaluate state-of-the-art controllers and establish the efficacy (if any) of learning-based approaches that leverage deep neural networks in one way or another.",
