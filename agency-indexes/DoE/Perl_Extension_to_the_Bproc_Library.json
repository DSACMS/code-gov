    "description": "The Beowulf Distributed process Space (Bproc) software stack is comprised of UNIX/Linux kernel modifications and a support library by which a cluster of machines, each running their own private kernel, can present itself as a unified process space to the user. A Bproc cluster contains a single front-end machine and many back-end nodes which receive and run processes given to them by the front-end. Any process which is migrated to a back-end node is also visible as a ghost process on the fron-end, and may be controlled there using traditional UNIX semantics (e.g. ps(1), kill(1), etc). This software is a Perl extension to the Bproc library which enables the Perl programmer to make direct calls to functions within the Bproc library. See http://www.clustermatic.org, http://bproc.sourceforge.net, and http://www.perl.org",
