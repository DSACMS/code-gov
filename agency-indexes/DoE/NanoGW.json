    "description": "NanoGW can perform the following calculations:\n\n1. Linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (by solving Casida equation)\n2. Full-frequency GW calculation with or without LDA vertex function (does not support spin-orbit coupling)\n3. Construct and solve Bethe-Salpeter equation\n\nNanoGW has been tested thoroughly and optimized for molecules and nanoclusters. It runs particularly efficient for small-size (less than 30 atoms) molecules or clusters. This package can also deal with crystalline systems. However, its functionality for dealing crystals has not been thoroughly tested yet.",
