    "description": "BIGSTICK Is a flexible configuration-Interaction open-source shell-model code for  the many-fermion problem In a shell model (occupation representation) framework. BIGSTICK can generate energy spectra, static and transition one-body densities, and expectation values of scalar operators. Using the built-in Lanczos algorithm one can compute transition probabflity distributions and decompose wave functions into  components defined by group theory.",
