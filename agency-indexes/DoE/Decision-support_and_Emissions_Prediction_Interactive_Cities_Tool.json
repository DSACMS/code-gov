    "description": "The Decision-support and Emissions Prediction Interactive Cities Tool (DEPICT) aims at predicting the cross-sectoral (building construction, operation and vehicles) energy consumption and greenhouse gases emissions at campus and urban scale. It leverages capabilities of multiple modeling tools: EnergyPlus for building operation, CalEEMod for building construction and gas vehicle, BEAM for electric vehicles and SAM for building\u2013integrated photovoltaics. It distinguishes from other cross-sectoral model such as CalEEMod or BEST in that it uses physical models, rather than empirical models, for all sectors, which allows for a more accurate and customizable quantification. It is relevant for short-term multi-sectoral decision making by developers and city planners and long-term policy making by municipal and state officials. Information about all the developers",
