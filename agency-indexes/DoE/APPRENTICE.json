    "description": "SF-19-096 In this software, there are multiple approaches to compute approximations to multivariate functions. This includes: (a) an approach that builds on Stieltjes process to efficiently compute the coefficients of the rational approximation, (b) an approach that is based on an optimization formulation to get pole-free coefficients of the rational approximation and (c) approaches that finds the coefficients of rational and polynomial approximations by finding the linear \nleast-squares solution using singular value decomposition.\n\n",
