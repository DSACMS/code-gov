    "description": "We developed the atomistic-coarse-grained multiscale MD simulation method in the OpenMM simulation package by iterating between the all-atom (AA) and coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations to enhance the sampling of biomolecular conformations. As the free energy surfaces are flattened during CG MD simulations, we can accelerate the transitions between different low-energy conformations. The AA-CG-AA cycles are repeated, facilitating the accelerated sampling of biomolecular conformations at a CG level, while the finer atomistic interactions are refined with AA simulators.",
