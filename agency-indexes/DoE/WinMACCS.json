    "description": "MACCS is the NRC code used to estimate the offsite radiological consequences of potential severe accidents at nuclear power plants (NPPs).  The code is used to perform probabilistic health and economic consequence assessment of hypothetical releases of radioactive material.  Atmospheric dispersion and transport, wet and dry deposition, probabilistic treatment of meteorology, environmental transfer, countermeasure strategies, dosimetry, health effects, site specific characteristics, evacuation/sheltering activities, and economic impacts are addressed in the code.",
