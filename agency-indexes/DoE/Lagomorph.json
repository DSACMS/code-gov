    "description": "Existing tools for computational anatomy and image registration are not aimed at HPC environments. As such they are not easily adapted to multimode platforms and contain inefficient batch processing modes. Lagomorph addresses this by providing an easy to install and use pure python implementation of very efficient image registration and atlas building which is aimed at extreme-scale anatomical studies using modern HPC and GPU resources.",
