    "description": "ZFP is a floating-point compression format gaining traction in high-performance computing applications. A\nsoftware implementation has demonstrated the ability to reduce data movement across communication\nchannels and to reduce the footprint of floating-point arrays in memory. Nevertheless, any benefit in\nperformance is limited to the spare compute cycles available before reaching bandwidth limitations. A\nhardware implementation of ZFP has the potential to substantially improve HPC application performance.\nHardware compression speedup over software alone on a single CPU core ranges from 15x for 1-D\narrays to over 200x for 3-D arrays.\nThe implementation of ZFP is sourced in SystemC to facilitate its evaluation in various architectures. The\nencode pipeline consists of several modules. Uncompressed blocks of floating-point numbers in IEEE\nformat flow into the pipeline in a stream and a compressed bitstream flows out from the pipeline. The\ndecode pipeline is the inverse of the encode pipeline. A modular design enables formats other than IEEE\n(such as posits) to be considered with minor adaptations. Best performance will be realized from the\nhardware ZFP unit when batches of blocks are processed at a time. The implementation supports 1-D, 2-\nD and 3-D blocks of floating-point numbers.\nThe hardware implementation of ZFP has been validated with the software implementation of ZFP. C++\ntemplate parameters are used to specify the bit width of floating-point numbers and the array dimension\nof the encoder. A test bench program has been created with several test cases, some with continuous\ndata that is ideal for ZFP, and others with extreme cases containing numbers near or at the maximum or\nminimum values supported by the number format.",
