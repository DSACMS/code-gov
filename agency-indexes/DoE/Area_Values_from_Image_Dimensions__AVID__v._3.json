    "description": "This code processes the images collected during high throughput tensile tests to measure the area of each specimen. First, the code identifies the reference images and primary sample images from list of images collected. Then, the size of the reference in the reference images is used to determine a scale (um/pixel) value which can be used to determine the size of each sample in an image. The subsequent sample images are processed to automatically detect the sample present and then identify the size in pixels. The measurements from two different views of the sample are then combined to determine the sample area (um2). ",
