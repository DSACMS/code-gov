    "description": "Project Schedule Comparison and Visualization allows project schedules to be compared across time scales. It also allows for visualization of schedules in the form of a network graph. This compliments Gantt chart view in major project risk management software.  The software mimics complex networks and makes it easy to visualize tasks and links. It produces a list with differences between snapshots. Selecting these differences renders a view focused on these changes in the network.",
