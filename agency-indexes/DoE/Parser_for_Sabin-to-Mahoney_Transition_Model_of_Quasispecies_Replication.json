    "description": "This code is a data parse for preparing output from the Qspp agent-based stochastic simulation model for plotting in Excel. This code is specific to a set of simulations that were run for the purpose of preparing data for a publication. It is necessary to make this code open-source in order to publish the model code (Qspp), which has already been released. There is a necessity of assuring that results from using Qspp for a publication",
