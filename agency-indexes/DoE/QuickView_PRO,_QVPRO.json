    "description": "QuickView PRO (QVPRO) is similar to QuickView but designed to focus on analysis. QuickView was designed for visualization only, adding analysis capabilities later. This made QuickView complicated when using it as an analysis tool. QVPRO uses the same analysis algorithms in a more streamlined workflow and has a user friendly GUI. QVPRO provides the unique capability of analyzing Photonic Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) data records from different PDV systems and still allows for processing hundreds of PDV data records in a practical manner.",
