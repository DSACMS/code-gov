    "description": "HavoqGT (Highly Asynchronous Visitor Queue Graph Toolkit) is a framework for expressing\nasynchronous vertex-centric graph algorithms, and executing them on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems. It provides a vertex 'visitor' interface, where actions are defined at an individual vertex level, and contains a suite of classic graph algorithms. HavoqGT is capable of processing large graphs stored in NVRAM (SSDs) using a memory mapped interface.\n",
