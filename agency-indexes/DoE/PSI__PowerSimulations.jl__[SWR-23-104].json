    "description": "PowerSimulations.jl is a Julia-based BSD- licensed power system operations simulation tool developed as a flexible and open source software for quasi-static power systems simulations including Production Cost Models. PowerSimulations.jl tackles the issues of developing a simulation model in a modular way providing tools for the formulation of decision models and emulation models that can be solved independently or in an interconnected fashion. \n\nFor further information regarding the Sienna modeling framework at NREL, see: https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/sienna.html",
