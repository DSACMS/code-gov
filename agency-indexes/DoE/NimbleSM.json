    "description": "NimbleSM is a Lagrangian finite-element code for solid mechanics.  Its primary application is the solution of mechanics problems on nonuniform, three-dimensional meshes using either explicit transient dynamic or implicit quasi-static time integration.  Additional features include multiscale modeling and the simulation of contact.  The NimbleSM code base is designed for performance portability across varying hardware architectures.",
