    "description": "Brief Description for Public Release:\nVarity is a framework to identify variations in floating-point programs through randomized differential testing. Varity generates random tests that include floating-point operations and compile these tests with different compilers in a system. It also generates random floating-point inputs for the tests. When tests are executed, the results are compared to identify variations in the results. Varity helps users of a system to identify the compilers that produce the most similar results in the system.",
