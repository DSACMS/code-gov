    "description": "This high-performance ray tracing library provides very fast rendering, compact code, type flexibility via C++ 'generic programming' techniques, and ease of use through an application programming interface (API) that functions independently of any GUI, on-screen display, or other enclosing application. Kip supports constructive solid geometry models based on any of several built-in shapes and operators and allows for new, user-defined shapes and operators. Additional features include basic texturing, input/output of models using a simple human-readable file format with full error checking and detailed diagnostics, and support for shared data parallelism. Kip is written in pure, ANSI Standard C++, is entirely platform independent, and is very easy to use, as it requires no build system, configuration or installation scripts, wizards, special preprocessing, makefiles, or external libraries.",
