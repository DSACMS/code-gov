    "description": "RAFT is a Python code for frequency-domain analysis of floating wind turbines. RAFT works in the frequency domain to provide efficient computations of a floating wind system's response spectra accounting for platform hydrodynamics, quasi-static mooring reactions, rotor aerodynamics, and linearized control. It can be used to calculate response amplitude operators (RAO's), power spectral densities, mean/static properties, and response metrics based on mean and root-mean-square values of each output. RAFT serves as the Level 1 model in the WEIS (Wind Energy with Integrated Servo-control) toolkit, and features an OpenMDAO wrapper.",
