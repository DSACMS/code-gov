    "description": "SAND2024-08478O\nThe spot_bt_ros tool allows users to easily construct complex autonomous behaviors for Boston Dynamic's Spot robot without having to overly rely on the Spot software development kit (SDK). This package specifically allows a user to run the Robot Operating System 2 alongside the SDK. Using a form-of-state machine called a \"behavior tree,\u201d the software develops different \"leaves\" or actions that the robot undergoes. Attaching multiple actions in sequence creates a \"branch\" and several of these make up the \"tree.\"\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
