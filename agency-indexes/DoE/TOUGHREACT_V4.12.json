    "description": "TOUGHREACT V4.12 is a 3-D reactive transport code that handles to non-isothermal, multiphase/multicomponent fluid flow, heat transport, aqueous and gaseous species advection-diffusion, and equilibrium/kinetic water-gas-rock-biological reactions.\n\nTOUGHREACT V4.12 is based on TOUGHREACT V3.3, with several new features including: an option to compute activity coefficients using the Pitzer ion interaction model; implementation of ECO2N V2.0 for temperatures up to 300 C; options to simulate forward and reverse osmosis, including 2D Poiseuille flow; addition of EOS8 and revisions for EOS5 and EWASG with H2(g); addition of gas species decay, various new output formats and time step control options; many bug fixes.",
