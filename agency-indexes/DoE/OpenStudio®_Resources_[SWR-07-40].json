    "description": "This repository includes a suite of simulation tests that can be used to validate new OpenStudio\u00ae model objects as well as ensure that objects continue to work after they are added. Each new OpenStudio Model object should ideally have two simulation tests associated with it: - a Ruby one which verifies the Ruby API and, - an OSM one that verifies the OSM file can be loaded with future versions of OpenStudio. Both tests should result in a simulation-ready OpenStudio Model that can be simulated using EnergyPlus\u00ae. Both of these tests are located in the /model/simulationtests directory, the easiest way to add a new test is to find a related existing test and modify it. When new tests are added they must be added to the model_tests.rb file.",
