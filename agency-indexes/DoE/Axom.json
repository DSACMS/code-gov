    "description": "Axom is an open-source library of \"building block\" software components that provide core infrastructure capabilities for HPC applications. Such capabilities include: input file parsing and verification for various file formats, format specification for material shape input to multi-material simulations and tools for placing those shapes on meshes, parallel distributed coordination of diagnostic messages, geometric primitives, spatial queries and spatial search acceleration data structures, in memory key-value data store for managing simulation data and parallel file I/O. Axom components are used widely across LLNL Advanced Simulation and Computing program applications. It is also part of the LLNL institutionally-supported RADIUSS project, which promotes and funds its adoption by projects across LLNL.",
