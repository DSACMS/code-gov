    "description": "A methodology and tool for computing the benefits and costs of Advanced Distribution Management Systems (DMS) for Grid Modernization. It suggests an approach for monetizing the \"functional\" benefits, expressed in non-monetary terms, such as System Average Interruption Duration Index/System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIDI/SAIFI) reduction and improved efficiency, using commonly available technical and financial parameters. It offers a model for individual utilities to determine the estimated costs and benefits using their own specific data. Where actual utility-specific data is not available, industry default values are offered. The model uses discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis to evaluate the economic justification for an investment in DMS.",
