    "description": "Graphene U-Net is a library that provides a simplified platform for training deep neural networks for the task of microscopy image segmentation. It contains functions and classes that make the process of training a neural network simple such that non-ML experts can train and evaluate models on their own datasets. It uses Pytorch as a backend and can run on both CUDA-enable GPUs and CPUs. It contains the main library file Microscopy_Unet.py as well as unet.py which contains the UNET model used for this software. This can be replaced with any other fully convolutional deep learning architecture with relative ease.",
