    "description": "CIGEN is a tool that finds input ranges that cause high compiler-induced numerical inconsistencies in\nnumerical programs written in a compiled language. Numerical program behavior may diverge when they\nare compiled and ran differently. Many factors, such as different hardware architectures (for example, the\nx87 FPU with its 80-bit registers), different compilers, or different optimization flags may cause the results\nof floating-point computations to become inconsistent. This kind of inconsistencies are known as\ncompiler-induced numerical inconsistencies. Given a program with floating-point inputs and an output,",
