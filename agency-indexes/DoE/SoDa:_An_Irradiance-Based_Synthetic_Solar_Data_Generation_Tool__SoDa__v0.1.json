    "description": "SoDa is an irradiance-based synthetic Solar Data generation tool to generate realistic sub-minute solar photovoltaic (PV) power time series, that emulate the weather pattern for a certain geographical location. Our tool relies on the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) to obtain irradiance and weather data patterns for the site. Irradiance is mapped onto a PV model estimate of a solar plant's 30-min power output, based on the configuration of the panel. We use a stochastic model with a switching behavior due to different weather regimes as provided by the cloud type label in the NSRDB, with parameters for the cloudy states trained on the high-resolution solar power measurements from a Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU).",
