    "description": "The Seismic Analysis Code (SAC2000) is a general purpose interactive program designed for the study of sequential signals, especially time-series data. Emphasis has been placed on analysis tools used by research seismologists in the detailed study of seismic events. Analysis capabilities include general arithmetic operations, Fourier transforms, spectral estimation techniques, IIR and FIR filtering, signal stacking, decimation, interpolation, correlation, and seismic phase picking. SAC2000 also contains an extensive graphics capability. Versions are available for a wide variety of computer systems. SAC2000 was developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.",
