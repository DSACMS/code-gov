    "description": "Facility CO2 Flow Tool assists facilities and entities to visualize their CO2 flows for accounting and decarbonization purposes. To do so, the suite offers two components \u2013 an MS Excel-based input workbook and a web-based visualization tool. The workbook serves as the input sheet, utilizing the user-provided process and equipment-level energy consumption data to calculate the corresponding CO2 emissions. The web-based tool utilizes the data from this workbook to generate a Sankey diagram. This diagram visually represents the CO2 flow originating from the fuel and electricity consumption within the facility/entity boundary.",
