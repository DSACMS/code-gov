    "description": "Deep learning has been applied with great success to the segmentation of 3D X-Ray Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Establishing the credibility of these segmentations requires uncertainty quantification (UQ) to identify problem areas. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), which use variational inference to learn the posterior distribution of the neural network weights, have been proposed to incorporate UQ into deep learning models.  This software is an implementation of a novel 3D Bayesian convolutional neural network (BCNN) that provides accurate binary segmentations and uncertainty maps for 3D volumes. In particular, the uncertainty maps generated by this BCNN capture continuity and visual gradients, making them interpretable as confidence intervals for segmentation usable in numerical simulations.
