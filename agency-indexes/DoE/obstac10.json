    "description": "Software infrastructure for using a custom (user-written) scheduler with the SISPI control system of DECam, and an example template for such a scheduler. This version of the obstac code is only infrastructure for supporting writing a scheduler, not a functional scheduler in itself: earlier versions of obstac that include the DES scheduler are part of SISPI, and not included as part of this package.",
