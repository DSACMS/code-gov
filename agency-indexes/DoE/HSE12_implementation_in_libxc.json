    "description": "This piece of software is a new feature implemented inside an existing open-source library. Specifically, it is a new implementation of a density functional (HSE, short for Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof) for a repository of density functionals, the libxc library. It fixes some numerical problems with existing implementations, as outlined in a scientific paper recently submitted for publication. Density functionals are components of electronic structure simulations, which model properties of electrons inside molecules and crystals.",
