    "description": "This package evaluates an analytic formula for the change in velocity imparted to an asteroid by a 1 or 2\nkeV black body source given the radius of the asteroid, the standoff distance, the x-ray yield, the density\nof the asteroid, and the fit coefficients for the 1 or 2 keV black body source (provided in the module).\nThree variations of the formula are given; the \"original\" form, the \"modified\" form that accounts for the\nangle of incidence in calculating the melt depth, and a form based on an \"impulse\" model.\nEach formula is fit to simulations of spherical asteroids of uniform composition illuminated by black body\nx-rays.",
