    "description": "This software package provides a common \"front end\" for various math operations that are relevant to astrophysical data processing. This includes special function evaluation, fast Fourier transforms, streamed random number generation and spherical geometry projections. Computer-vendor specific libraries and internal algorithms can be selected on different systems in order to achieve the best possible performance on all systems. This software is still in an early state of development. ",
