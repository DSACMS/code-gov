    "description": "With the DCA++ project, we aim to gain insight into the fascinating physics of strongly correlated electron systems by employing modern quantum cluster methods. The DCA++ code provides a state of the art implementation of the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) and its DCA+ extension. High scalability and portable performance allow to exploit today's leadership computing systems.",
