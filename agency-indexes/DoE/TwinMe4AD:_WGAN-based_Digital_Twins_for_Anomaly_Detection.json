    "description": "SAND2024-08373O\nTwinMe4AD is a Python-based software tool designed for anomaly detection using digital twins that closely mimic real, wearable healthcare datasets. The tool is invaluable for scenarios where collecting data is either expensive or impractical, serving as a privacy-preserving solution. Sensitive information is protected by training deep learning models on synthetic data derived from real datasets. One of TwinMe4AD's key features is its anomaly detection capability, which is based on fourth-order moments of parameters. This versatile approach can be applied across a range of datasets, from univariate to multivariate, making it compatible with various types of data. It also generates synthetic twins using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs), allowing users to create a small cohort of a population similar to that of a village population. \nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
