    "description": "SAND2021-14370 O Tesuract (tensor surrogate approximation and computation) provides Python tools to build machine learning regressors that include polynomial chaos expansions. The software also offers methods for creation regressors for tensor outputs such as spatially varying fields and using a reduced order modeling methodology. The library is built on and compatible with the scikit-learn API, which allows integration with one of the most ubiquitous machine learning Python libraries out there.
