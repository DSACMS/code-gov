    "description": "This is a software utility used to maximize next-generation sequencing data output without compromising quality values. The DNA Sequencing Optimizer is used to determine the optimal amount of library to load. To do this a supervised machine learning model predicts cluster density, a measure of how much DNA is bound to the sequence, from the concentration of DNA loaded. The output is a plot that is used by experimentalists to determine the best DNA library concentration to load onto the sequencer.",
