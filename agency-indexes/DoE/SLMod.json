    "description": "The software is a modular framework for controlling data acquisition systems (DAQs) for radiation detectors. Its capabilities include hardware configuration and control as well as data readout and storage. In addition to a generalized extensible framework for building DAQs, the package also includes specific implementations for a number of commercially available hardware devices commonly used in nuclear instrumentation (digitizers, high voltage controllers, etc.).",
