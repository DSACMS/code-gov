    "description": "Xanthos is a Python package designed to quantify and analyze global water availability in history and in future at 0.5\u00b0 \u00d7 0.5\u00b0 spatial resolution and a monthly time step under a changing climate. Its performance was also tested through real applications. It is open-source, extendable and convenient to researchers who work on long-term climate data for studies of global water supply, and Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM). This package integrates inherent global gridded data maps, I/O modules, Water-Balance Model modules and diagnostics modules by user-defined configuration.",
