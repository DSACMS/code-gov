    "description": "skyline is a header-only C++ library for the direct solution of linear algebraic equations that are stored in skyline format. It is intended for medium-sized sparse problems with moderate bandwidth. This solution approach has historically been used for pressure network solvers and in some finite element codes. It was developed to replace legacy solver code included in the EnergyPlus building energy modeling software package, but is not limited to use by EnergyPlus.",
