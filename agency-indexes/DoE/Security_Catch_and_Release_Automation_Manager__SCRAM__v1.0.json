There is a list of currently blocked traffic, a place for other tools to automatically add traffic they deem malicious, as well as for human users to input blocks.\n\n* Logging and auditing, to determine who made what change and when\n* Automated expiration of changes (e.g. an exception is added for 2 weeks, after which time it will be removed)\n* Validation of changes and verification that the change has been applied\n* Fine-grained role-based access",
