    "description": "CGYRO is a multi-species spectral gyrokinetic solver with sonic rotation capability. It is an Eulerian GK solver specifically designed and optimized for collisional, electromagnetic, multiscale simulation. A key algorithmic aspect of CGYRO is the radially spectral formulation used to reduce the complicated integral gyroaveraging kernel into a multiplication in wavenumber space, but retaining the ability to treat profile variation important for edge plasmas. This makes it suitable for\nnext-generation computational systems that require high levels of parallel concurrency.\n",
