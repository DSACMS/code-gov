    "description": "LIGR (Linear Grains) implements a linear (Fourier mode) analysis of a shock propagating through density perturbations. It has two primary capabilities. First, it calculates the shock front distortion and post-shock flow variables (density, velocity, pressure) for single Fourier mode pairs in two dimensions (a pair of x and y modes). Second, it calculates these same quantities for a grains-like pre-shock density perturbation, which consists of a sum of many Fourier modes. This grains-like perturbation is a periodic grid of rectangles at a specifiable density and size (the grains), separated by regions of a different specifiable size and density (interstitial spaces between the grains). The single-mode analysis is based on the work of Velikovich et al., Phys. Plasmas 14 072706 (2007).",
