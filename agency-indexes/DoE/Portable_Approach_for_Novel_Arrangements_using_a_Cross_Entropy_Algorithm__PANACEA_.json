    "description": "PANACEA provides a means for generating unique configurations. The primary motivation for its development stems from the need to generate unique configurations for the purpose of training machine learned interatomic potentials. PANCEA is a C++ library with python and linux scripts. The C++ library is the engine which provides can be installed and used to measure the disorder/order of a system via the information entropy. The python and linux scripts provide useful helper functionality such as visualization of files that can be output from the library.",
