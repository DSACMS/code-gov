    "description": "This is a MATLAB-based tool to post process simulation results in the EPRI software TRANSCARE, for massive cascading failure analysis following severe disturbances. There are a few key modules available in this tool, including: 1. automatically creating a contingency list to run TRANSCARE simulations, including substation outages above a certain kV threshold, N-k (1, 2 or 3) generator outages and branch outages; 2. read in and analyze a CKO file of PCG definition, an initiating event list, and a CDN file; 3. post process all the simulation results saved in a CDN file and perform critical event corridor analysis; 4. provide a summary of TRANSCARE simulations; 5. Identify the most frequently occurring event corridors in the system; and 6. Rank the contingencies using a user defined security index to quantify consequences in terms of total load loss, total number of cascades, etc.",
