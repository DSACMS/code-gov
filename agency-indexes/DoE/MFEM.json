    "description": "Mirror of MFEM - a lightweight, general, scalable C++ library for finite element methods. MFEM is a modular parallel C++ library for finite element methods. Its goal is to enable the research and development of scalable finite element discretization and solver algorithms through general finite element abstractions, accurate and flexible visualization, and tight integration with the hypre library.\n",
