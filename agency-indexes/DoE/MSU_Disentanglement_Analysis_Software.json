    "description": "This software is used to disentangle the forced-versus-unforced components of tropospheric temperature change over the satellite era (after 1979) using maps of surface temperature change as a predictor. In general, the software assembles training datasets (from pre-computed surface temperature trend maps and domain averaged tropospheric warming rates), trains statistical/machine learning (ML) algorithms, applies the trained statistical/ML model to climate model data and observations, and then saves the results. A leave-one-out approach is used in which the statistical/ML models are iteratively trained on (N- 1) climate model and then applied to the remaining climate model (and observations). Each model includes a large ensemble (i.e., &gt;10) of model simulations. The software relies on scikit-learn ridge regression, PLS regression, and neural network algorithms.",
