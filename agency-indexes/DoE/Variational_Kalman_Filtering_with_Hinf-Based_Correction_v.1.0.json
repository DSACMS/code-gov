    "description": "SAND2024-01664O\nThis software demonstrates the usage of the Variational Kalman Filtering with Hinf-Based Correction software, which can be used to calculate the mean and covariance of the estimate of a high-dimensional parameter. The software performs this task faster than the traditional Kalman filtering technique.
