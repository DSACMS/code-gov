    "description": "ROL provides interfaces to and implementations of algorithms for gradient-based unconstrained and constrained optimization. ROL can be used to optimize the response of any client simulation code that evaluates scalar-valued response functions. If the client code can provide gradient information for the response function, ROL will take advantage of it, resulting in faster runtimes. ROL's interfaces are matrix-free, in other words ROL only uses evaluations of scalar-valued and vector-valued functions. ROL can be used to solve optimal design problems and inverse problems based on a variety of simulation software.",
