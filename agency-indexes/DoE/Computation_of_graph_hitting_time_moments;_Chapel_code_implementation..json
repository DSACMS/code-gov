    "description": "The project that developed this is unclassified, with the mandate to produce open source code. This code computes the hitting time moments of a graph using a linear algebra configuration. The goal of this work is to explore the performance capabilities of the Chapel programming language. Toward that end, we generate random adjacency matrices which represent a random graph. The code can also read in an adjacency matrix from a file. The main computation is the Conjugate Gradient method.SAND2020-12651 M.\n\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
