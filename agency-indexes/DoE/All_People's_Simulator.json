    "description": "The All People's Simulator is a software package which can simulate a large number of people wandering randomly through a real city. It utilizes freely-available map data from the OpenStreetMaps project to create a map of city streets, then simulates people wandering through those streets. APS was designed to integrate with other work being done in the \"Megadroid\" LDRD, but is capable of functioning and providing value completely on its own.",
