    "description": "The software takes any deterministic simulation code (non-specific) and modifies identified variables in the input-deck for the simulation code before launching a \"run\" of the code. This process is repeated N times and is useful for Probabilistic Risk Assessment studies as well as any other study requiring many parametric changes to variables in a deterministic code.",
