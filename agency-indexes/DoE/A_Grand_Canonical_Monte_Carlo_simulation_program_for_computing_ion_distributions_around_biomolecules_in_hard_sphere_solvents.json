    "description": "The GIBS software program is a Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation program (written in C++) that can be used for 1) computing the excess chemical potential of ions and the mean activity coefficients of salts in homogeneous electrolyte solutions; and, 2) for computing the distribution of ions around fixed macromolecules such as, nucleic acids and proteins. The solvent can be represented as neutral hard spheres or as a dielectric continuum. The ions are represented as charged hard spheres that can interact via Coulomb, hard-sphere, or Lennard-Jones potentials. In addition to hard-sphere repulsions, the ions can also be made to interact with the solvent hard spheres via short-ranged attractive square-well potentials.",
