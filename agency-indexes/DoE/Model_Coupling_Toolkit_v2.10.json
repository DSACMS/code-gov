    "description": "MCT is a set of open-source software tools for creating coupled models. MCT is fully parallel and can be used to couple message-passing parallel models to create a parallel coupled model. MCT is available as a small library and a set of Fortran90 modules. Interoperability is through a simple API. Two models that declare and use MCT datatypes can be coupled with a minimum of effort.",
