    "description": "This program is a portable, open-source, compiler for the UPC language. It is based on the Open64 framework and has extensive support for optimizations. This compiler operates by translating UPC into ANSI/ISO C for compilation by a native compiler and linking with the UPC Runtime Library. This design eases portability to both shared- and distributed-memory parallel architectures. For proper operation it requires the \"Berkeley Unified Parallel C (UPC) Runtime Library\" and its dependencies. \n",
