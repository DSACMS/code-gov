    "description": "The modeling tool developed in the current project provides lifetime assessment of three candidate materials 740H, 282 and 625 for sCO2/molten salts heat exchanger. The tool incorporated physics-based models that accounted for all relevant underlying degradation mechanisms (creep and corrosion). Reduced-order models enabled rapid simulations of realistic component lifetimes (~100kh) while still retaining the fidelity of the complex models.",
