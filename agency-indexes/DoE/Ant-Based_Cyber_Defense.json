    "description": "ABCD is a four-level hierarchy with human supervisors at the top, a top-level agent called a Sergeant controlling each enclave, Sentinel agents located at each monitored host, and mobile Sensor agents that swarm through the enclaves to detect cyber malice and misconfigurations. The code comprises four parts: (1) the core agent framework, (2) the user interface and visualization, (3) test-range software to create a network of virtual machines including a simulated Internet and user and host activity emulation scripts, and (4) a test harness to allow the safe running of adversarial code within the framework of monitored virtual machines.",
