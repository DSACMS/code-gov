    "description": "The SST provides a parallel framework to perform system simulation of computer architectures to determine their performance and power consumption. Additionally, the SST contains basic models of a computer processor, and interconnect and can connect to an external memory simulator (DRAMSim II). The SST framework provides a simple interface by which other computer simulation models can be combined under a common parallel discrete event-based simulation environment. This allows design exploration of future architectures, analysis of how current computer programs will function on future architectures. The SST provides a parallel discrete event simulation framework, including partitioning and object distribution over MPI. It also provides a mechanism by which components can report their power consumption for analysis.",
