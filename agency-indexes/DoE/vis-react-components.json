    "description": "In developing visualizations for different data sets, the end solution often become dependent on the data being visualized. This causes engineers to have to re-develop many common components multiple times. The vis-react components library was designed to help enable creating visualizations that are independent of the underlying data. This library utilizes the React.js pattern of instantiating components that may be re-used. The library exposes an example application that allows other developers to understand how to use the components in the library.",
