    "description": "ExaDigiT is a framework for developing comprehensive digital twins of liquid-cooled supercomputers, which has three main modules: (1) a python-based Resource Allocator and Power Simulator (RAPS), (2) a Modelica-based Thermo-Fluidic cooling model, and (3) a C++-based augmented reality model built on Unreal Engine 5. The Modelica-based cooling model is primarily built-on the open-source Transient Simulation Framework\nof Reconfigurable Models (TRANSFORM) library and the open-source autocsm library.\nThe library follows the templating architecture developed in the TRANSFORM and the autocsm libraries. This tool can be easily extended to model other Frontier-like liquid cooled supercomputers.",
