    "description": "Aluminum is an optimized GPU-aware communication library. It provides a generic Interface to high-performance allreduce algorithms, with support for additional collective operations in progress. Blocking and non-blocking algorithms and GPU-aware algorithms are supported. Aluminum contains custom Implementations and Interfaces to existing optimized communication libraries, exposed through a generic API. ",
