    "description": "MuMMI RAS is the application component of the Multiscale Machine-Learned Modeling Infrastructure (MuMMI). It simulates RAS protein interactions at three scales of resolution coupled with ML-based selection and in-situ feedback. MuMMI RAS is particularly configured for massive scale, running thousands of simultaneous jobs with several terabytes of data on Lassen and Summit.",
