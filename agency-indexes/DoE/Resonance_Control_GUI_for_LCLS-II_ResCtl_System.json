    "description": "Resonance Control GUI for LCLS-II ResCtl System is a Qt5-based, python GUI used for interacting with an LCLS-II resonance control system for an 8-cavity cryomodule. The code is written in Python, and can use auxiliary software Qt5, pyqtgraph, numpy, and scipy. The code is operating system-agnostic, has no specific hardware requirements, and has no embedded source code.",
