    "description": "Clang Unified Parallel C 2 C (Clang UPC2C) translator compiles programs written in the UPC (Unified Parallel C) language to ISO C99, with calls to the Berkeley UPC runtime system. The Clang UPC2C compiler extends the capabilities of the Clang LLVM C frontend to comply with the UPC Language Specification version 1.3. The compiler generates programs that run on a wide variety of systems ranging from workstations to leadership-class supercomputers, in conjunction with the Berkeley UPC runtime and GASNet communication system. In addition to the standard UPC libraries, Clang UPC2C also provides access to Berkeley UPC library extensions.",
