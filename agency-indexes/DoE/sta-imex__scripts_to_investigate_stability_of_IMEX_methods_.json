    "description": "Set of Matlab scripts to investigate properties of IMEX time stepping methods. Scripts include discretization of a system of linearized equations. One script plots numerical dispersion against analytical dispersion of the system. Another set of scripts uses the system to break it into stiff and non stiff part to investigate stability of Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta methods. \n\nScripts are based on \nThuburn, J. and Woollings, T. J., Vertical Discretizations for Compressible Euler Equation Atmospheric Models Giving Optimal Representation of Normal Modes , 2005 and\nLock, S.-J. and Wood, N. and  Weller, H., Numerical analyses of Runge-Kutta implicit-explicit schemes for horizontally explicit, vertically implicit solutions of atmospheric models, 2014\nexpanding ideas from these two papers.\n\nScripts are used to develop IMEX schemes.
