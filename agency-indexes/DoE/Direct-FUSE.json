    "description": "The Direct-FUSE framework supports multiple FUSE file systems as well as other, custom user-level file\nsystems in user space without the need to cross the user/kernel boundary into the FUSE kernel module.\nAll layers of Direct-FUSE are in user space, and applications can directly use pre-defined unified file\nsystem calls to interact with different user-defined file systems. Our performance results show that Direct-\nFUSE can outperform some native FUSE file systems by 11.9% on average and does not add significant\noverhead over backend file systems.\n",
