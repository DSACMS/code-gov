    "description": "This software is a package for assimilating data from multiple radars and models together to create a 3D wind retrieval over a region. The framework is based off of the minimization of a cost function related to the varying sensors, mass continuity, and model. Since it is open source the community is able to contribute and expand the package to use data from their own desired model or sensor. ",
