    "description": "This license is for a computer-science focused subset of the XCP-3 developed shared component libraries (SHACL), referred to as SHACL Utilities. The SHACL Utilities product is a collection of repositories developed to help XCP-3 developers quickly write maintainable and efficient computational physics software. This collection of libraries provides software abstractions, algorithms, and tools based on modern software practices and design idioms, while supporting interfaces to other programming languages when required by production codes. The libraries are semi-independent repositories and are developed with an emphasis on performance and sharing code between applications.",
