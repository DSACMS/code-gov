    "description": "A Browser-based visualization of morphology, material, and chemical data extracted from chemical papers. This UI is focused for specifically nanomaterial synthesis papers. The visual analytic environment allows the user to explore a large number of papers quickly, through an interactive, intuitive, and visual way that helps see possible trends in the data. This exploration-oriented systems allows domain experts who may not have an extensive background in writing analysis code or database queries to easily express their idea to experiment on the data and view the results.\nThe visualization software requires the data in JSON format. The data packaged with the software is the result of 35k nanomaterial synthesis papers queried from Elsevier, created through a separate software pipeline. The data contains information such as the title, authors, chemicals, and created material and morphology.",
