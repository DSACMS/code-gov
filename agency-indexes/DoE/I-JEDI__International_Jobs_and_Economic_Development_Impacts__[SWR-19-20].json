    "description": "The International Jobs and Economic Development Impacts (I-JEDI) model is a free, online tool for analyzing the economic impacts of renewable energy development. The tool estimates the potential gross economic impacts of wind, solar, biomass and geothermal energy projects for a specific country.\n\nI-JEDI estimates the employment, earnings, gross domestic product, and output from the construction and operation of renewable energy projects and across the domestic supply chain. The model results include total economic impacts as well as impacts by industry (e.g., construction, manufacturing, banking services, etc.). This information helps align renewable energy action with key economic development goals. I-JEDI was developed through the USAID-NREL Partnership to support informed renewable energy decisions.",
