    "description": "FAST.Farm is a multi-physics engineering tool for predicting the performance and loads of wind turbines within a wind farm. FAST.Farm uses FAST to solve the aero-hydro-servo-elastic dynamics of an individual turbine, but adds additional physics for wind farm-wide ambient wind in the atmospheric boundary layer; a wind-farm super controller; and wake deficits, advection, deflection, meandering, and merging. FAST.Farm is based on the principles of the Dynamic Wake Meandering (DWM) model\u2014including passive tracer modeling of wake meandering\u2014but addresses many of the limitations of previous DWM limitations. FAST.Farm maintains a low computational cost to the often highly iterative and probabilistic design process. Applications of FAST.Farm include reducing wind farm underperformance and loads uncertainty, developing wind farm controls to enhance operation, optimizing wind farm siting and topology, and innovating the design of wind turbines for the wind-farm environment.",
