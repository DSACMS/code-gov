    "description": "PNNL created a visualization tool that was tested with real control room operators and IT cybersecurity professionals. The tool enabled adequate communications between the two parties such that they were able to adequately address OT cybersecurity issues. The visualization tool was developed based on an iterative design process, factoring in observations and interviews with the end users, and considering the cognitive workload of the operations staff.",
