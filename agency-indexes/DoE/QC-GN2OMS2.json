    "description": "The QC-GN2OMS2 neural network was designed to predict mass spectra better than currently available approaches. Fundamentally the neural net is designed to input the structure of a molecule and collision energy value then output a spectra datafile for the end user. This software is able to make predictions orders of magnitude faster (milliseconds) than QC methods and with 50-60% greater accuracy than rules approaches.",
