    "description": "This work presents a method of performing PARAFAC2 factorization of a three-way data using a compact representation of the data.  The data are decomposed into a core matrix and sets of orthogonal loading matrices.  The algorithm is particularly useful for very large data sets and essentially permits imposition of nonnegativity in all three modes.
