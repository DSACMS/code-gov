    "description": " Service that returns similar genomes from a given assembly/genome ID. A genome \"sketch\" is a set of preprocessed data that makes it fast to compare genomes and get a similarity score. This is useful for doing genome searches, where you can find a list of similar genomes from a query genome. This is a KBase dynamic (persistent) service that takes workspace IDs pointing to Assemblies, Genomes, or Reads and returns a list of similar genomes.",
