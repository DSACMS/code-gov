    "description": "JPype is a Python module to provide full access to Java from within Python. It allows Python to make use of Java only libraries, exploring and visualization of Java structures, development and testing of Java libraries, scientific computing, and much more. By gaining the best of both worlds using Python for rapid prototyping and Java for strong typed production code, JPype provides a powerful environment for engineering and code development. This is achieved not through re-implementing Python, as Jython has done, but rather through interfacing at the native level in both virtual machines. This shared memory based approach achieves decent computing performance, while providing the access to the entirety of CPython and Java libraries.",
