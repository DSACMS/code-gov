    "description": "The open source Project Haystack initiative defines meta data and communication standards related to data from buildings and intelligent devices. The Project Haystack REST API defines standard formats and operations for exchanging Haystack tagged data over HTTP. The HaystackRuby gem wraps calls to this REST API to enable Ruby application to easily integrate data hosted on a Project Haystack compliant server. The HaystackRuby gem was developed at the National Renewable Energy Lab to support applications related to campus energy. We hope that this tool may be useful to others.",
