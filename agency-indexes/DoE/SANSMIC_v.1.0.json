    "description": "SAND2024-01036O\nThe updated Sandia Solution Mining Code (SANSMIC) modeling software models the dissolution of underground salt cavern walls due to raw-water injection (leaching), assuming an oil blanket. A previous version of this software modeled the impacts of leaching at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and has been used in research for several decades, but the source code was not available. The new version will enhance current research as additional subsurface storage of energy in solution-mined caverns increases. It will also allow research reproducibility by making the software available to the wider research community. \nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
