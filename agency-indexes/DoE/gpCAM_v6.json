    "description": "gpCAM is tailored to be used by experimentalists who want to steer experiments autonomously. It is based on a Gaussian process (GP). Its strength compared to other software lies in its flexibility, which together with the right training, makes it more powerful than any GP-based software. However, that means, that the software in as-is mode cannot reach its full potential.",
