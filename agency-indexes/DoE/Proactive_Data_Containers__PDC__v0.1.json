    "description": "As extreme-scale era software, we are developing novel object- based data abstractions and storage mechanisms that take advantage of the deep storage hierarchy and enable proactive automated performance tuning. In order to achieve these goals, we have developed a fundamental new data abstraction, called Proactive Data Containers (PDC). A PDC is a container within a locus of storage (memory, NVRAM, disk, etc.) that stores science data in an object-oriented manner.",
