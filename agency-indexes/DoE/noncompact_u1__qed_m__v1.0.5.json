    "description": "This software generates QED fields in which the photon has a finite mass, and also the 0-mode subtracted scheme. They are intended to be used with lattice QCD calculations to understand the QED corrections to nuclear physics processes that are being computed with lattice QCD. To the best of my knowledge, this will be the only publicly available software that generates background QED configurations with massive photons. ",
