    "description": "SAND2023-07864O\nScribe Network API is an add-on tool for Scribe3D software. Scribe Network API documents tabletop exercises in trainings and plays back simulated videos of the scenarios and responses. Users can apply the software to compiled projects, or to a simple visual studio project solution package. The software runs a web application that relays information between computers using Scribe3D through a web application, or web app. The web app involves a representational state transfer (REST) application programming interface that handles sending and receiving Scribe save files and an SQL server that stores the save files. This follow-on package allows users to facilitate a networked tabletop exercise. \nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
