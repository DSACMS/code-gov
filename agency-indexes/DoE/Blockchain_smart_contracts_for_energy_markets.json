    "description": "A successful architecture that depicts the relationship between the energy market engineering requirements and blockchain requirements\n(shown as enablers). Software includes sequential and relational architectures supported by the UML flow diagrams. For a successful blockchain agnostic implementation of energy markets, the proposed architecture/blueprint supported by prototype implementation is very efficient. The proposed invention also depicts various means of the use of\nblockchain technology for energy market systems.",
