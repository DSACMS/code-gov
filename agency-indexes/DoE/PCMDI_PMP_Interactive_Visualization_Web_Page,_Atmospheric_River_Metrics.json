    "description": "We present an open-source Python-based framework that can be used for objective evaluation of\nAtmospheric Rivers (ARs) in climate models. With a comprehensive pool of pre-defined metrics, this\npackage is useful for systematic AR evaluation across a range of model simulations, such as the MIPs in\nCMIP5/6 models and large ensemble experiments.",
