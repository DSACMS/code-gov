    "description": "Combinatorial materials science experiments involve synthesis and spatially-resolved characterization of thin film sample libraries. As a result, the modern combinatorial materials science laboratory produces large, diverse, and complex data sets, requiring automation of analysis and visualization techniques. COMBIgor is a software package aimed to assist a combinatorial material scientists with large volumes of experimental data. This package, written in Igor Pro, offers a systematic approach to the loading, processing, and visualizing combinatorial data sets. COMBIgor is designed to be expanded on a laboratory, group, or individual basis to adopt additional loading, processing and visualization capabilities. By utilizing COMBIgor software package the burden of data management in combinatorial materials science experiments can be significantly reduced.",
