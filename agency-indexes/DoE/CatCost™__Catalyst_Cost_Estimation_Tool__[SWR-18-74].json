    "description": "CatCost\u2122 is a state-of-the-art cost estimation tool designed to reduce the cost uncertainty associated with pre-commercial catalyst materials. The tool combines industry-standard cost estimation methods and resources into an intuitive suite of tools to bring actionable cost insight to every step of catalyst research and development. CatCost\u2122 allows the rapid development of comprehensive catalyst cost estimates. It incorporates detailed insight into manufacturing methods, especially for pre-commercial catalysts, without requiring any process design experience.\n\nThe tool has been designed from the ground up with a number of user-selectable estimation methods, pricing libraries, and ease-of-use features to tailor an estimate to a user's skill level and need for customization, empowering researchers of all skill-levels to make better R&D decisions throughout the catalyst development cycle. Our costing methods are fully transparent and enable power-users the ability to adjust any estimate to the economic realities of their operation.\n\nThe tool has been designed from the ground up with a number of user-selectable estimation methods, pricing libraries, and ease-of-use features to tailor an estimate to a user's skill level and need for customization, empowering researchers of all skill-levels to make better R&D decisions throughout the catalyst development cycle. Our costing methods are fully transparent and enable power-users the ability to adjust any estimate to the economic realities of their operation.\n\nFeatures include:\nRaw materials pricing: Libraries of common chemicals, cost scaling indices, guidance for obtaining bulk quotes, and methods for extrapolating laboratory-scale prices to bulk.\nSimplified step method for synthesis by a contract manufacturer: All-in hourly cost for process equipment using methods and data from tollers.
