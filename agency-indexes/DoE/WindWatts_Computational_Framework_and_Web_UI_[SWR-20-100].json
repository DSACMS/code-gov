    "description": "This software provides a collection of algorithms, an API, and a functional Web UI for the Distributed Wind\u2019s WindWatts project. DW WindWatts is a DOE WETO-funded project aimed at the development of tools to supporting the distributed wind  industry, particularly with respect to siting and resource assessment. The computational framework and the back-end API are powering the easy to use front-end services available at: https://windwatts.nrel.gov.\n\nhttps://github.com/NREL/dw-tap-api; https://github.com/NREL/dw-tap; https://github.com/NREL/windwatts-data\n\nFor reference, this software was previously known as DW TAP Computational Framework.",
