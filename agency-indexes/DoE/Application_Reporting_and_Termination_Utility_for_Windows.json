    "description": "The Application Reporting and Termination Utility for Windows (terminate.exe) is a simple diagnostics and recovery tool designed to help LANDesk system administrators manage hung client applications on Windows systems. Terminate can either report on (tag) or stop (kill) a specified process on computers on which it is run. If KILL is specified, all processes that match the specified name and have a start time older than the specified minutes will be force stopped.  If TAG is specified, all processes that match the name and have a start time older than the specified minutes will be reported to LANDesk inventory via the miniscan LANDesk client component.",
