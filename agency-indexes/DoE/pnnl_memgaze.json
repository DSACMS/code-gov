    "description": "MemGaze is a memory analysis toolset that combines high-resolution trace analysis and low overhead measurement, both with respect to time and space. It provides high-resolution by collecting world-level memory access traces, where the highest resolution supported is back-to-back sequences. It achieves low-overhead in space and time by leveraging sampling and various methods of hardware support for collecting traces. Its post-mortem trace processing provides multiresolution analysis for locations vs. operations\u037e accesses vs. spatio-temporal reuse, and reuse (distance, rate, volume) vs. access patterns.",
