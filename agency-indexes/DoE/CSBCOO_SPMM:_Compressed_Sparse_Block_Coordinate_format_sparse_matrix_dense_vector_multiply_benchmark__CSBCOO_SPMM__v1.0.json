    "description": "The purpose of this microbenchmark is to provide a means to explore different programming methodologies using a simple, but not trivial, mathematical kernel. The kernel is based on the matrix vector product in the MFDn nuclear configuration interaction code's LOBPCG eigensolver. This particular mathematical operation is a key element in the solution of systems of equations and block eigensolvers.",
