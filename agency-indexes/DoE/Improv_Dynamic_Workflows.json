    "description": "A workflow is a series of dependent computations which are executed to\nyield an experimental result, much like sheet music describes a musical\nperformance. Dynamic workflows are like improvisational jazz, in which\nthe musicians create unique, situation-driven, collaborative variations\non themes. Dynamic workflows can potentially yield better results, save\ncomputation, and/or save human decision-making effort versus pre-specified\nor manual workflows, as they need not run the exhaustive set of studies\nwhich might be required in a pre-specified set, and they make their own\nexperimental design decisions at run time. If you have an existing\nMaestro study where you would like to save computation and/or human time,\nImprov is for you.\nImprov provides core capabilities for creating a simple, hierarchical structure over Maestro studies,\nallowing you to connect ``experimental'' Maestro strudies with decision-making code to select parameters\nand run corresponding studies.",
