    "description": "A cosmic ray Muon Flexible Framework for Spectral GENeration for Monte Carlo Applications (MUFFSgenMC) has been developed to support state-of-the-art cosmic ray muon tomographic applications. The flexible framework allows for easy and fast creation of source terms for popular Monte Carlo applications like GEANT4 and MCNP. This code framework simplifies the process of simulations used for cosmic ray muon tomography.",
