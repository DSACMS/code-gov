    "description": "Establishes the input/output dependencies between individual application tasks, schedules and executes them on available computing resources in order of their dependencies. Uses statistical modeling algorithms to summarize the properties of the tasks to present to users a compact view of the surrent state of the overall application tasks and the effectiveness of various runtime optimizations on such tasks to improve utility of scheduling. Finally, uses statistical models to predict availability of computing resources",
