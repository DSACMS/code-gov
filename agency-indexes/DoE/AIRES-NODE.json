    "description": "This software package performs time series forecasting for engineering systems using neural controlled differential equations.   Neural controlled differential equations are continuous time analogues to recurrent neural networks.  AIRES-NODE is particularly well suited for dynamic systems which are subject to external forcing terms and time-dependent boundary conditions.  AIRES-NODE provides an encoder-decoder architecture which allows for variable-length forecasts to be made and is not limited to a fixed time step size when forecasting.  Additionally, by utilizing a novel combination of a variational autoencoder and neural controlled differential equations, the AIRES-NODE package is capable of producing probabilistic future forecasts.",
