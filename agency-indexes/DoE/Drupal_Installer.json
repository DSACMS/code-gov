Installer plugins can be created through Composer's plugin API (https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/custominstallers.\nmd) allowing certain types of packages to be automatically installed to specific paths. Plugins like this exist for\nseveral different frameworks: https://packagist.org/search/?q=installer&type=composer-plugin\nThis software is a plugin to install Drupal modules (https://www.drupal.org/). Drupal has begun supporting Composer as a means of installing and maintaining modules, but requires specific paths for it's various components. These paths can be\nmanually specified in the \"composer.json\" file, or can be automatically determined with a plugin. Currently an installer\nplugin does not exist for Drupal.",
