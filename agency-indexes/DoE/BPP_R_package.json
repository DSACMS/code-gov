    "description": "The BPP package contains R code to perform Bayesian projection pursuit regression under various regression settings. Bayesian projection pursuit regression learns the functional relationship between inputs and outputs by considering a sum of functions of one dimensional projections of the inputs. This is useful as a general machine learning software.",
