    "description": "FriendlyNets provides a method for assessing the promotion/inhibition effect on a microbe of a microbial community using a network of community interactions. At its core, FriendlyNets judges how much a network promotes or inhibits one of its nodes. It does this by assuming a set of dynamical systems represented by the network and using the resulting dynamics. FriendlyNets is also packaged with functions for generating a network from a set of genome-scale metabolic models (commonly called GSMs or GEMs) by simulating pairwise growth.",
