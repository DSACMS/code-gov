    "description": "SEPIA (Simulation-Enabled Prediction, Inference, and Analysis) is a Python port, with user interface enhancements, of GPMSA software. GPMSA is released as LACC-06-079. \nThe software performs analysis and uncertainty quantification, by comparing experimental observations to ensembles of computer simulations. \nThis software is based on the methodology of Higdon et.al 2008, https://doi.org/10.1198/016214507000000888 .",
