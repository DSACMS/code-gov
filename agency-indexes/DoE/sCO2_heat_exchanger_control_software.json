    "description": "SAND2022-6992 O The sCO2 Heat Exchanger Control Software was written for control and operation of high temperature, high pressure supercritical CO2 systems designed for use as heat exchangers. The software was written using the basic LabVIEW package with LabVIEW modules added to it. The software controls valves and actuators, displays data from pressure transducers and thermocouples, and is able to record data at different storage rates. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
