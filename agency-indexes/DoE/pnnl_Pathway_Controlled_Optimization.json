    "description": "A method for prediction of cell regulation to maximize cell growth rate while maintaining the solvent capacity\nof the cell. Prediction is formulated as an optimization problem using a thermodynamic framework that can leverage\nexperimental data. We develop a formulation and variable initialization procedure that allows for computing solutions of\nthe optimization with an interior point method",
