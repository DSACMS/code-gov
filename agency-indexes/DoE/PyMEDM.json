    "description": "The PyMEDM package is a Python-native port of Penalized-Maximum Entropy Dasymetric Modeling (P-MEDM) method. While the original implementation of P-MEDM consists of an R interface over a model written in C++, PyMEDM combines both capabilities in a common language that interfaces with other utilities in the Likeness stack. PyMEDM is also GPU-enabled via JAX , which supports High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications.",
