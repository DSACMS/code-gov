    "description": "VERTEX-CFD is primary used for safety analysis and design optimization of fusion blankets. VERTEX-CFD has a highly flexible code structure that facilitates the addition of new features such as equations, boundary conditions, and source terms. VERTEX-CFD is designed to run on CPU- and GPU-enabled high-performance computing (HPC) platforms by relying on Kokkos. The code architecture supports a plug-and-play approach allowing equations to be coupled by selecting the correct set of input parameters in the XML format input file. A set of verification and validation problems were run to test VERTEX-CFD solver. VERTEX-CFD implements the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled to a temperature equation and magneto-hydrodynamic equations. This code is being developed for fusion applications.",
