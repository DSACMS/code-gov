    "description": "The Lagrangian Droplet cloud microphysics scheme uses high-resolution data of air velocity, temperature, and water\nvapor mixing ratio to drive particle-based simulations of cloud microphysics. The model was first implemented using a\nhigh-resolution Large Eddy Simulation of the Pi Chamber at Michigan Tech, which is small-scale convection chamber the\ngenerates clouds in a laboratory setting",
