    "description": "SAND2022-4247 O\nLocOO3d is used to estimate the location of seismic events by comparing estimates of the arrival time for seismic waves from hypothesized locations to observed arrival times. LocOO3d also computes errors in estimated locations through the computation of an \u201cerror ellipsoid\u201d around the optimal event location.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
