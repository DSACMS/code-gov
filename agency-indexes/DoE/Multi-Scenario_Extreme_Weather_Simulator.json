    "description": "The Multi-scenario Extreme Weather Simulator (MEWS) takes existing historical weather data and inserts trends and extreme events such as heat waves, hurricanes, extreme precipitation, or winter storms. The code includes functionality for projecting increasing frequency and duration of such events over a large range of statistically sampled realizations of the future. These weather files can then be used in building energy simulations through the Energy Plus software created by DOE. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525 SAND2021-8658 O",
