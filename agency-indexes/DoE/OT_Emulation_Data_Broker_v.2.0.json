    "description": "SAND2021-11479 O The OT Emulation Data Broker system allows Simulink models to be connected to an emulated control system network. The package includes a Simulink S-Function that allows communication to the data broker via inter process communication; a data broker, which orchestrates communication between the emulated control system network and the simulation; an endpoint, which facilitates communication between the data broker and PLC's on the control network using ModBus/TCP; and an example PLC structured text files that work with OpenPLC, an open source emulated PLC.
