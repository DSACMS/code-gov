    "description": "The software in development is a model of convection to be added to a public domain 1-dimensional supernova code.  The supernova code models the collapse and explosion of stars.  Without a convection module, the 1-dimensional code does not include the effects of convection under an entropy gradient.  The modules that will be integrated into this code will calculate this convection.",
