    "description": "SAND2022-12898 O\nDGTile is a lightweight C++17 adaptive mesh library meant to support explicit discontinuous Galerkin applications on high performance computing machines. DGTile uses a block-based adaptive mesh refinement approach, where the underlying mesh data structure is an octree in three dimensions, where each leaf node of the tree represents a Cartesian grid. Over each grid, DGTile provides modal discontinuous Galerkin basis functions to facilitate simulations. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
