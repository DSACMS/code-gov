    "description": "SAND2024-08577O\nCanonical and Noncanonical Hamiltonian Operator Inference is research code that applies old and new model reduction algorithms to well-known and publicly available \"toy\" problems. It applies operator inference (OpInf) methods for model reduction to several benchmark hyperbolic partial differential equations: linear wave, Korteweg-de Vries, Benjamin-Bona-Mahoney, and linear elasticity.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
