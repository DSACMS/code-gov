    "description": "The NREL Wattile extension, nrelWattileExt, provides an interface between SkySpark, an energy management and analytics software, and Wattile, an NREL-developed Python package for probabilistic prediction of building energy consumption. Wattile models predict discrete quantiles of the probability distribution of a target quantity (typically energy consumption) using the historical time series data from one or more predictors (typically weather data). Within SkySpark, predictions from Wattile models can be used for measurement & verification of building performance, detection of energy anomalies, and fault detection.\n\nRelated to: https://github.com/NREL/Wattile",
