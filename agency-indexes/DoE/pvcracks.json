    "description": "SAND2024-00922O\nThis software uses electroluminescence images to predict power loss due to cell cracks in photovoltaic modules. The software will incorporate trained variational autoencoder(s) to parameterize cell cracks detected in electroluminescence images of photovoltaic modules and relate cracks to electrical properties; reduced-order models of finite element simulations of electrical behavior of photovoltaic modules under thermomechanical stresses; reduced-order models of stress distributions; inside photovoltaic modules resulting from x-ray topography experiments; and image segmentation and splining methods to analyze x-ray topography measurements of cracked photovoltaic cells.  \nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
