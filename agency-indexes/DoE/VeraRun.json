    "description": "VeraRun provides users a command-line utility that determines the sequence of VERA codes and utilities to be executed, calculates and determines PBS directives and job parameters, creates a job script, and submits the script on behalf of the user. While hiding all the details, the script allows the user to set PBS parameters explicitly. VeraRun is implemented as a Python package with host-specific configurations and job script templates. Host configurations are stored in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files and specify machine characteristics (e.g., number of nodes, number of processors per node, memory available per node, location of VERA installations). Job templates are Bash scripts with parameters substituting for host-specific PBS directives and controls. These files are named by the hostname, thus making VeraRun extensible to other systems and environments. VeraRun reads the VERA input file to determine code and execution environment requirements, creating and optionally submitting a job script.",
