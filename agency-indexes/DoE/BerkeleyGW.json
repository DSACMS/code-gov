    "description": "BerkeleyGW is a versatile, massively parallel, GPU-enabled, modular software package for quantum many-body perturbation theory applied to study the excited state properties of electrons in materials. It employs the ab-initio GW and GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) methods and beyond. It can be used to investigate a wide range of materials from bulk crystals to clusters and 2D/1D materials, adapting to insulating, metallic, and semi-metallic systems alike.
