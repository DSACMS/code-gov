    "description": "The molecular graphics program, PyMol, was employed to produce all images in the training/validation/testing datasets. A\nPyMol script identified the clusters of interest from a list of all proteins containing 1) Fe (III) and Fe (II) ion and 2) FeS,\nrespectively. A PyMol script and a Python webscraper were also used to classify [2Fe-2S] cofactors into three classes:\nstandard, Rieske, and other and to identify iron atoms with four cysteine residues. We also used the pyMol script to rotate\namino acids for training",
