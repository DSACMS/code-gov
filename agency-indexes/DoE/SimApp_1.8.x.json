    "description": "System for converting DESIRE (Direct Executing Simulation in Real Time) simulation models to executable code models (C# / C++). These converted models are used as the basis for 2 products, one of which is the focus of this review: an engineering design interface for Fissile Solution Systems. ModelConverter.exe (C#) converts DESIRE model inputs to a C++ plug-in subclass. SimApp.exe (C# / C++) has a C++ dll that is a numerical integration engine that the Converted models plug into. The engineering design interface is a C# GUI that calls on the C++ dll to execute a particular converted model. The GUI allows the user to specify the length of a simulation, run the simulation, view data plots and data tables. Stability plots may also be produced and manipulated. The engineering design interface will be released as source code and executable; the model converter source is also intended for release.",
