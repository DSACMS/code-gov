    "description": "This software is a package of MATLAB functions which analyzes optical flow data to perform analysis on the motion contained in microscopy videos taken of beating heart cells. The resulting information is used to quantify key features of the motion such as frequency, magnitude, and correlation. This software can be applied to analyze different types of movement such as heart and muscle cell contractions frequency, beat strength, and overall beat synchronization.",
