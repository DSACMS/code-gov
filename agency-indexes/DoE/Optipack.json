    "description": "Used to solve basic unconstrained optimization problems that can produce smooth accurate gradients. These are standard published unconstrained optimization such as are described in the book Nocedal and Wright Numerical Optimization: 2nd edition, 2006. This software is generic to any mathematical optimization problem where smooth derivatives exist. There is no specific connection or mention whatsoever to any specific application, period. You cannot find more general mathematical software.OptiPack contains some simple optimization algorithms built on Thyra. Currently, only a few different nonlinear conjugate gradient methods are implemented.",
