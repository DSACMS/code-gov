    "description": "bifacial_radiance contains a series of Python wrapper functions to make working with RADIANCE easier, particularly for the PV researcher interested in bifacial PV performance. Users can configure site details such as latitude / longitude, and ground albedo. A bifacial PV system is created with a number of PV modules in rows. The user can specify ground clearance height, row spacing, tilt and azimuth angle, etc. The scene is created, and annual or hourly irradiance profiles are applied to identify the rear irradiance fraction for a given condition.",
