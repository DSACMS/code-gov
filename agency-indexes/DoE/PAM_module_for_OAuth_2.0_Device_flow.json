    "description": "This is a PAM module that lets you log in via SSH to servers using OpenID Connect credentials, instead of SSH Keys or a username and password combination. It uses the OAuth2 Device Flow, which means that during the login process, you will click a link and log in to your OpenID Connect Provider, which will then authenticate you for the SSH session. This module will then check if you're in the right group(s) or have a specified username, and allow or deny access.",
