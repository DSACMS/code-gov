    "description": "Much strain-specific sequence data exists in research conducted before the deployment of large sequencing repositories, making it challenging to identify and validate the identity of strains used in these studies through bioinformatics and phenotyping. The American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) is an organization that sells a wide variety of microbes with strain-level taxonomy classification and associated sequenced reference genomes. Currently, ATCC does not provide a method for searching for sequence similarity between a query sequence and their database of reference genomes. Here I propose the software ATCCfinder, which utilizes ATCC application interface software (API) to generate query-able databases from ATCC Genome resources.",
