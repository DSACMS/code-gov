    "description": "NWQSim is a quantum circuit simulation environment developed at PNNL. It currently includes two major components: a state-vector simulator (SV-Sim) and a density matrix simulator (DM-Sim) and we may add more components, such as a Clifford simulator, in the future effort. NWQSim has two language interface: C/C++ and Python. It supports Q#/QDK frontend through QIR and QIR-runtime. It supports Qiskit and Cirq frontends through OpenQASM. NWQSim runs on several backends: Intel-CPU, Intel-Xeon-Phi, AMD-CPU, AMD-GPU, NVIDIA-GPU, and IBM-CPU. It supports three modes: (1) single processor, such as a single CPU (with and without AVX2 and AVX512 acceleration), a single NVIDIA GPU or a single AMD GPU\u037e (2) single-node-multi-processors, such as multi-CPUs/Xeon-Phis, multi-NVIDA/AMD GPUs\u037e (3) multi-nodes, such as a CPU cluster, a Xeon-Phi cluster (e.g., ANL Theta, NERSC Cori), an NVIDIA cluster (e.g., ORNL Summit, NERSC Perlmutter).",
