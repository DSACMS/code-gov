    "description": "ExaMPM is a mini-application for the Material Point Method (MPM) for studying the application of MPM to future exascale computing systems. MPM is a general method for computational mechanics and fluids and is used in a wide variety of science and engineering disciplines to study problems with large deformations, phase change, fracture, and other phenomena. ExaMPM provides a reference implementation of MPM as described in the 1994 work of Sulsky et.al. (Sulsky, Deborah, Zhen Chen, and Howard L. Schreyer. \"A particle method for history-dependent materials.\" Computer methods in applied mechanics and engineering 118.1-2 (1994): 179-196.). The software can solve basic MPM problems in solid mechanics using the original algorithm of Sulsky with explicit time integration, basic geometries, and free-slip and no-slip boundary conditions as described in the reference. ExaMPM is intended to be used as a starting point to design new parallel algorithms for the next generation of DOE supercomputers.",
