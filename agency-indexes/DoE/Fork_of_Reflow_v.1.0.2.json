    "description": "SAND2025-00898O\nFork of Reflow is a software tool that extends the functionality of NASA Reflow to support relevant projects. It provides automated reasoning support for floating-point roundoff error in numerical computer programs. The tool integrates with Frama-C and the PVS theorem prover to specify and verify program properties, ensuring compliance with specifications through weakest-precondition style analysis. This fork enhances automated reasoning features and enables direct analysis of C code, making it suitable for applications involving small programs with floating-point computations. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
