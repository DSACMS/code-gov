    "description": "G2Aero is a flexible and practical tool for design and deformation of 2D airfoils and 3D blades using data-driven approaches. G2Aero utilizes the geometry of matrix manifolds\u2014specifically the Grassmannian\u2014to build a novel framework for representing physics-based separable deformations of shapes. G2Aero offers the flexibility to generate perturbations in a customizable way over any portion of the blade. The G2Aero framework utilizes data-driven methods based on a curated database of physically relevant airfoils. Specific tools include:\n- principal geodesic analysis over normal coordinate neighborhoods of matrix manifolds;\n- a variety of data-regularized deformations to nominal 2D airfoil shapes;\n- Riemannian interpolation connecting a sequence of airfoil cross-sections to build 3D blades from 2D data;\n- consistent perturbations over the span of interpolated 3D blades based on dominant modes from the data-driven analysis.",
