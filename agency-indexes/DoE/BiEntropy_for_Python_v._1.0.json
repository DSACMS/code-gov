    "description": "This Python package provides high-performance implementations of the functions and examples presented in \"BiEntropy - The Approximate Entropy of a Finite Binary String\" by Grenville J. Croll, presented at ANPA 34 in 2013. https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0954\n\nAccording to the paper, BiEntropy is \"a simple algorithm which computes the approximate entropy of a finite binary string of arbitrary length\" using \"a weighted average of the Shannon Entropies of the string and all but the last binary derivative of the string.\"",
