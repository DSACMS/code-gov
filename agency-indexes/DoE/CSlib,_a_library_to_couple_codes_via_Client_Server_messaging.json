    "description": "The CSlib is a small, portable library which enables two (or more) independent simulation codes to be coupled, by exchanging messages with each other.  Both codes link to the library when they are built, and can them communicate with each other as they run.  The messages contain data or instructions that the two codes send back-and-forth to each other.  The messaging can take place via files, sockets, or MPI. The latter is a standard distributed-memory message-passing library.",
