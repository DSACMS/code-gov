    "description": "3D design documents for 3D printing.  The holes in the electrode cage are designed to condense hydrogen into progressively larger\nbubbles, and to direct the flow of hydrogen from the cathode up and out of the bioreactor so it is kept away from the anode\nand collected as nearly pure hydrogen.",
