    "description": "Calibr8 provides an application to rapidly prototype and perform material model calibration for complex plasticity models using advanced adjoint or forward sensitivity analyses for execution on massively parallel machines. These techniques can be orders of magnitude faster than traditional finite difference approaches for material model calibration. The underlying technology used in Calibr8 is automatic differentiation, which allows for the rapid implementation and testing of new plasticity models within its framework. Additionally, Calibr8 can perform adjoint-based error estimation to approximate discretization errors for user-implemented plasticity models.
