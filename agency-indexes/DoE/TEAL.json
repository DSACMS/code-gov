    "description": "TEAL is a financial performance calculator plugin for the RAVEN code, framework, resolving around the computation of Net Present Value and associated financial metrics. TEAL can make use of inflation rates, taxation, escalation factors, capital expenditure economy of scale scaling factors. The unique feature of TEAL is the capability to be linked with RAVEN external models and build corresponding cash flows using the variables computed by those external models. In addition to be able to use the capability to generate cash flows derived from complex physical models generated by RAVEN, another distinctive feature of TEAL is the capability to provide financial risk/probabilistic metrics that can empower RAVEN to perform optimization/analysis driven by financial risk augmentations. Optimization, robust optimization, parametric studies, large parallel simulations, sensitivity analysis, data mining, etc. are just some of the capabilities that can be leveraged.",
