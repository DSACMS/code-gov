    "description": "SAND2022-14744 O The Deep Learning Denoiser uses a trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model to decompose an input waveform into a signal and noise waveform. In the approach, the CNN provides a signal mask and a noise mask for an input signal. The Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) of the estimated signal is obtained by multiplying the signal mask with the STFT of the input signal.
