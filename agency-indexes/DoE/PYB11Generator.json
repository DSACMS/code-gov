    "description": "PYB11Generator is a code generator to simplify using the open-source pybind11 package for interoperability between C++ and Python.  PYB11Generator parses a description of the C++ code to be exposed to Python written in pure Python syntax, and generates the pybind11 C++ coding which can be compiled into a shared library allowing the C++ code to be used from Python.  The purpose of PYB11Generator is to simplify this process of binding together C++ and Python, removing much of the redundant code needed by pybind11 such as trampoline classes for providing virtual function overrides in Python.",
