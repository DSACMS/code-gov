    "description": "This software contains the code for a machine learning-based pipeline for creating persistent waterbody databases used in hydrologic routing. It consists of three components, 1) a PyTorch library (TorchWBType) for classifying/labeling arbitrary waterbodies into lakes and non-lakes, 2) a batch processing orchestrator (wbextractor) for delineating waterbodies from remote sensing imagery, and 3) graphing/analysis scripts for reproducing the plots in an associated journal article (LA-UR-24-22590).",
