    "description": "The Gravitation and Mesh Adaptation (GaMA) toolbox consists of a set of Matlab classes for modeling the environment around asteroids and comets. A variety of gravitational models and supporting algorithms from are consolidated alongside a custom meshing utility tailored for the application. This allows the user to work within a single streamlined environment to import and manipulate surface definitions, probe the dynamical environment, integrate trajectories, and post-process results. For other applications, modified surface meshes can be exported. Gravity Models: 1) Werner's analytic polyhedron model 2) Mascon model 3) Gottlieb's spherical harmonic model 4) Approximate polyhedron models 5) Curvilinear surface models 6) Custom composite models Meshing Features: 1) Array-based half-edge data structure 2) Supports curvilinear surface definitions up to degree 4 3) Ray-tracing 4) Coarsening 5) Feature-based refinement 6) Projection 7) Smoothing 8) Mesh quality validity tests 9) Mesh repair Additional Features: 1) Solar radiation pressure model 2) Distant 3rd body model 3) Collision detection 4) Trajectory integration and post-processing 5) Visualization of surface fields",
