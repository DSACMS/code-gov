    "description": "The webtool displays the following types of data:\n\nWastewater treatment plants (WWTP) with anaerobic digestion\nFacilities with anaerobic digestion onsite other than WWTP\nCombustion plants.\nManure locations.\nManure (non points)\nMunicipal solid waste locations\nCrop locations\nProcessor residue (non points)\nDistrict energy systems\nMixed use developments (non points)\nProcess heating and cooling locations\nBasic Usage\nUsers can interact with the map in the following ways:\n\nSelect the year of the analysis from a drop-down menu.\nSet the background layer as biomass availability or thermal consumption density from a drop-down menu.\nSelect whether the facility of interest is an Anaerobic Digestion or a Therochemical facility from a drop-down menu. This filters the biomass data by moisture and only shows the relevant portions based on the facility selection.\nSelect from a drop-down menu whether the biomass amounts will be shown as gross amounts or technical amounts.\nSet the radius for the search buffer in which the analysis will be performed.\nClick on any point data on the map to get more information.\nClick on the map, to given the signal of the query point location, from where the algorithmic process is going to initiate. This will show the available biomass locations and amounts that fall within the predefined buffer zone.\nDownload the data in a csv format for the entire county or the selected biomass that is inside the predefined buffer.\nReport whether there are errors in the data to us and we will work to the best of our abilities to confirm and fix any issues.\nThe outputs of the algorithmic process are going to appear on the screen after the computation is done. The outputs consist of the locations of all available biomass that are within the buffer zone from the clicked location. By clicking on any point the user can get more information on the nature and amounts of the biomass.",
