    "description": "Derivatives are required in many contexts: optimization, sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis, and parameter estimation. The radolc package is an interface to ADOL-C == a C++ library that facilitates the computation of first and higher derivatives of vector functions that are defined by computer programs. ADOL-C can compute gradients, the Jacobian matrix, the Hessian matrix, Jacobian vector products and Hessian vector products.",
