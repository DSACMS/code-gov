    "description": "Arion is a library and tool set that enables researchers to holistically define test system models. To define a complex system for testing an algorithm or control requires expertise across multiple domains. Simulating a complex system requires the integration of multiple simulators and test hardware, each with their own specification languages and concepts. This requires extensive set of knowledge and capabilities. Arion was developed to alleviate this challenge. Arion is a library of Java libraries that abstracts the concepts from supported simulators into a cohesive model language that allows someone to build models to their needed level of fidelity and expertise. Arion is also a software tool that translates the users model back into the specification languages of the simulators and test hardware needed for execution.",
