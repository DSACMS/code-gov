    "description": "This pair style will enable molecular dynamics simulations of hydrogen interaction with Fe-C steels. No such simulations are possible without such a pair style. This is significant because Fe-C steels are the most commonly used steels and improving their resistance to hydrogen embrittlement has attracted wide interests.
