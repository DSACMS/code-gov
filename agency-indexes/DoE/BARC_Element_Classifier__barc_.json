    "description": "SAND2024-02120O\nThis program enumerates and classifies all possible functional elements in several different categories within the Ballistic Asynchronous Reversible Computing (barc) model of computation. barc software is a research tool that is being used to help document the possible digital behaviors of primitive functional elements in the ABRC a.k.a. BARC model of computation.  \n\nThe method of operation of this software leverages elementary concepts and methods from discrete mathematics: combinatorics (permutations), partitions and equivalence classes, symmetry transformations, and the theory of finite groups. Implementation is in Python programming language. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
