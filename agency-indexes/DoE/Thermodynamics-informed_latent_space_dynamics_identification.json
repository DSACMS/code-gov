    "description": "This software showcases a latent space dynamics identification method, namely tLaSDI, that embeds the\nfirst and second principles of thermodynamics. The latent variables are learned through an autoencoder\nas a nonlinear dimension reduction model. The latent dynamics are constructed by a neural network-based\nmodel that precisely preserves certain structures for the thermodynamic laws through the\nGENERIC formalism. An abstract error estimate is established, which provides a new loss formulation\ninvolving the Jacobian computation of autoencoder. The autoencoder and the latent dynamics are\nsimultaneously trained to minimize the new loss. Computational examples demonstrate the effectiveness\nof tLaSDI, which exhibits robust generalization ability, even in extrapolation. In addition, an intriguing\ncorrelation is empirically observed between a quantity from tLaSDI in the latent space and the behaviors\nof the full-state solution.",
