    "description": "Model that supports drone deployment. Analysis on speed, package weight, energy consumption, # of drones, and battery replacements. This software developed tools for drone deployment optimization for direct delivery by introducing a new model that presents new insights addressing real-life issues. Specifically, this developed a new mixed-integer programming model with both time windows and battery replacements.",
