    "description": "PolyPole is a numerical algorithm for the calculation of intra-granular fission gas release. In particular, the algorithm solves the gas diffusion problem in a fuel grain in time-varying conditions. The program has been extensively tested. PolyPole combines a high accuracy with a high computational efficiency and is ideally suited for application in fuel performance codes.",
