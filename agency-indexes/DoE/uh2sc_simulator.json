    "description": "SAND2024-08546O\nThe underground hydrogen gas salt cavern (uh2sc) simulator software will be used to understand how hydrogen gas injection and extraction rates affect energy efficiency of weekly to monthly H2 storage. Salt cavern dynamics include: Heat transfer to the surrounding walls, gas dynamics, dissolution into brine at the bottom of caverns, multi-species gas mixtures of H2 and natural gas or other cushion gasses, and structural creep of the salt cavern or closure due to under-pressure in the cavern. The model is designed to interface with surface hydrogen system dynamics models via co-simulation. This is so it can be used as an individual tool to understand injection and extraction of H2, common faults in caverns (i.e. a leak vs. creep closure or other issues), model predictive control, and other applications. \nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
