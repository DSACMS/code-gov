    "description": "beluga is an open-source optimal control software that uses publicly available, indirect methods from GitHub. beluga's indirect optimization engine has been reworked to follow a lazy functional paradigm. This improves the software's flexibility and enables users to create their own optimization processes without modification of the source code. beluga is general-purpose and therefore very broad in scope and application.
