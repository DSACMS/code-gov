    "description": "SHIVER (SARS CoV-2 Historically Identified Variants in Epitope Regions) analyzes and summarizes the historical record of amino acid sequences for the Spike protein of the SARS Cov-2 virus.  The analysis is focused on the N-terminal domain (NTD) and Receptor Binding domain (RBD) epitope regions, and aims to choose a set of variant forms that collectively cover a large fraction of the sequences in the alignment as a whole (globally) but also that cover large fractions of sequences collected on the different continents.  The software provides a set of Spike protein sequences in a standard (fasta) sequence format.",
