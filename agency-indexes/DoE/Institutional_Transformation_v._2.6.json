    "description": " IX uses whole building analysis, and solar power cost algorithms  to evaluate tradeoffs associated with alternative large-scale, long term facilities energy conservation strategies.  It is designed to use existing energy simulation tools such as doe2.2 and SAMS to produce detailed results which are then processed at a higher level. ",
