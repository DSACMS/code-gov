    "description": "SAND2023-05510O\nGNATFinder is a software tool for extracting graphical neural activity threads (GNATs) from spiking neural networks. GNATFinder efficiently extracts GNATs from spiking neural network data. A GNAT is a graph that represents the causal relationships between individual spikes in a spiking network using a combination of the network connectivity structure and the timing of individual spikes. The software allows for identifying similar, repeating threads that often reappear in a dataset. Using quadtree data structures to recursively subdivide the time interval over which spikes were produced by the spiking network, GNATFinder allows for efficient pairwise comparisons of spike times to determine the degree of causal relatedness among all pairs of spikes in a dataset. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
