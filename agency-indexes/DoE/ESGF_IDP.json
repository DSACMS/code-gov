    "description": "The Yadis discovery service is a simple web application that returns XML documents containing URLs for user services. It has no significant library dependencies. The Openid Server functionality is based on the openid4java library, currently the version modified by ESGF to support attribute providers. It uses Spring for managing the application configuration through dependency injection, but it does not use any Spring Security (except for enforcing HTTPS connections), since Spring Security does not support the server-side functionality of the openid exchange. The Openid Client package is a small application provided as a facility to test the Openid Server. It relies on Spring Security support for the client-side openid, which is in turn based on the openid4java library also.\n",
