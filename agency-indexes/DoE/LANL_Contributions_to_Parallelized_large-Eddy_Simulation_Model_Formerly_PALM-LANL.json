    "description": "PALM-LANL is a model system for conducting large-eddy simulations, that is, simulations of turbulence that only resolve the largest turbulent eddies and rely on a turbulence closure scheme to represent the smallest turbulent eddies. PALM-LANL is based on PALM version 5.0 but it contains numerous modifications by LANL authors to add research capabilities. PALM is written for atmosphere and ocean turbulence; PALM-LANL includes modifications and additions to the ocean turbulence components, analysis, and data output capabilities. ",
