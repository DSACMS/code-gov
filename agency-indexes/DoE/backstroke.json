    "description": "Backstroke is a tool for reversible computation and supports C++11. It is a command line tool for generating reversible C++ source code and is distributed with a runtime library that can maintain all data necessary to support reversibility. The runtime library implements a so called Runtime State Store (RTSS) and is called rtss library. Backstroke implements a technique for incremental state saving (also called incremental check-pointing). Backstroke supports the simulator ROSS for parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) and can establish automatically the reversibility of ROSS models.\n",
