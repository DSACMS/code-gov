    "description": "In the repository are example scripts that perform uncertainty injection and propagation to flux balance analysis with outputs for a small sample size (for demonstration purpose only). For proper analysis, user should download the scripts and run for a large sample size (e.g., 10,000 samples).\n\nIf you use the scripts, please cite the following Metabolic Engineering article: \u201cQuantifying the propagation of parametric uncertainty on flux balance analysis\u201d (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2021.10.012)\n\nThere are two subdirectories:\n\n/uncFBA/uncBiom: injection of normally distributed noise to biomass precursor coeffcients and ATP maintenance (growth-associated ATP maintenance (GAM) and non-growth associated ATP maintenance (NGAM))\n/uncFBA/uncRHS: departure from steady-state by adding noise drawn from normal distribution to the RHS terms of mass balance constraints",
