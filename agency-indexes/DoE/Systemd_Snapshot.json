    "description": "Systemd Snapshot is a static analysis tool for Linux systems that use systemd. It aims to enumerate, aggregate, and investigate systemd services without requiring an operational system. The tool produces a set of JSON files that consolidates not only systemd information, but additional forensic information associated with systemd artifacts. A graph is also produced based on the relationships and ordering defined in systemd unit files and the binaries they specify.",
