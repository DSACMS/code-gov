    "description": "FABLE is a Fortran to C++ source-to-source conversion tool. This enables the continued development of new methods even while switching programming languages. FABLE is available under a nonrestrictive open source license. In FABLE the analysis of the Fortran source is separated from the generation of the C++ source. Therefore parts of FABLE could be reused for other target languages. Hardware req.: Multi-platform; types of files: source code, sample problem Input data, sample problem output, installation instructions, user guide.",
