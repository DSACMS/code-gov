The toolkit is located in:\nhttps://mybitbucket.llnl.gov/projects/SAL/repos/smoe_lovi/browse. It is a set of of PyTorch related python\nscripts for extracting the what parts of an image are most salient to a deep neural network in an efficient\nmanner. This source will allow one to replicate the results in the paper referenced above.\nIs there",
