    "description": "SMAQC computes quality metrics for a LC-MS/MS dataset. The quality metrics are based on the metrics proposed by Rudnick and Stein, as described in \"Performance metrics for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry systems in proteomics analyses.\", Mol Cell Proteomics. 2010 Feb;9(2):225-41. SMAQC requires that the dataset first be processed with MASIC, then processed with MSGF+ or X!Tandem. The MSGF+ or X!Tandem results must be post-processed with the PeptideHitResultsProcessor (PHRP).",
