    "description": "SANDAL is a particle-mesh simulation mini-app. The simple simulated physics propagates a set of particles in a constant, 2D wind field with Gaussian turbulence. SANDAL demonstrates the feasibility of formulating a computational physics problem using an alternative, modern design. Specifically, it is implemented using relational tables and queries, rather than array-based data model. It also is implemented with functional language design and cloud deployment, Scala and Apache Spark, rather than Fortran and MPI+X.",
