    "description": "OpenStudio-HPXML allows running residential EnergyPlus\u2122 simulations using an HPXML file for the building description. It is intended to be used by user interfaces or other automated software workflows that automatically produce the HPXML file.\n\nOpenStudio-HPXML can accommodate a wide range of different building technologies and geometries. End-to-end simulations typically run in 3-10 seconds, depending on complexity, computer platform and speed, etc.\n\nFor more information on running simulations, generating HPXML files with the appropriate inputs to run EnergyPlus, etc., please visit the documentation linked below.\n\nhttps://openstudio-hpxml.readthedocs.io/en/latest",
