    "description": "T3CO (Transportation Technology Total Cost of Ownership), is open source software for modeling total cost of ownership for commercial vehicles with advanced powertrains.\n\nT3CO is a modeling framework for determining geospatially and temporally optimized total cost of ownership (TCO) for vehicle powertrain technologies. T3CO runs NREL's FASTSim\u2122 software for a representative set of operating conditions to minimize TCO based on vehicle parameters that affect purchase and operating costs (e.g., fuel/electricity consumption, asset depreciation, opportunity costs associated with charging time) while simultaneously ensuring that firm performance constraints (e.g. zero-to-sixty time, gradeability) are satisfied. T3CO will enable the user to control which powertrain parameters are used in optimizing TCO, and these parameters will be modified by a multi-objective optimization (MOO) algorithm to identify a Pareto-optimal solution set. The optimization algorithm will be modular so that users can choose from many different MOO options or insert their own user-defined optimization tool.\n\nNREL T3CO Homepage: https://www.nrel.gov/transportation/t3co.html\nPyPI package: https://pypi.org/project/t3co/",
