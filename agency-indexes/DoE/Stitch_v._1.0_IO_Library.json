    "description": "Stitch is a new IO library focused around supporting simulations where only a small portion of the simulation space changes at each timestep. It improves storage efficiency by only storing the changed data and constructs on request a view of an arbitrary region at a given time by stitching together parts of various outputs. This enables scaling from a single process to 100s of nodes.",
