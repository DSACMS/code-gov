    "description": "SAND2023-06720O\nHod Carrier is a simple proof-of-concept library for moving data from host to NVIDIA BlueField device memory using remote direct memory access. The Hod Carrier software also facilitates research activities related to the potential uses of NVIDIA BlueField data processing unit devices. Using well-established technologies (e.g., RDMA over Infiniband), it will move data from the host to the data processing unit\u2019s memory. This software is a middleware utility for moving data without regard to its semantic meaning. Its operation is fundamentally unaffected by storage allocation.   \nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
