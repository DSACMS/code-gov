    "description": "This code solves the Vlasov-Poisson equations in 6-dimensions without approximation. It uses sparse grid discretization to solve the high-dimensional PDEs. The code functions as a discontinuous Galerkin finite element solver. Advantages/benefits include no approximations, supports high-dimensionality, leadership-scale capability, and implicit time advance.",
