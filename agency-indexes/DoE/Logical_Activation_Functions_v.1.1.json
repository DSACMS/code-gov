    "description": "SAND2024-01501O\nLogical Activation Functions software is a PyTorch implementation from the paper, \"Logical Activation Functions for Training Arbitrary Probabilistic Boolean Logic.\" The activation functions approximate logit-space marginalization of probabilistic truth tables from probabilistic interpretations of inputs. They also provide a general methodology to approximate logical relationships between abstract antecedents and consequents for machine learning architectures. They do not target any specific application or use-case. By training probabilistic truth tables, these activation functions can capture more expressive relationships in a neural network than typical elementwise activation functions. \n\nThis code is only designed for a single compute node with a GPU and is limited to machine learning architectures than can fit within the memory of a single GPU. \n\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
