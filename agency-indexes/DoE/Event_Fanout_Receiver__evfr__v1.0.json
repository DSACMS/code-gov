    "description": "The event fanout-receiver is an event-based timing system implementation capable of synchronizing (with respect to clock, events and triggers) to an upstream event generator. This can be used in 2 modes: fanout or receiver. the first one receives 1 upstream timing streams and fanouts it to 36. The second one receives and decodes the stream. This has been in use by ALS for many years and this is a similar implementation, but providing a more flexible configuration",
