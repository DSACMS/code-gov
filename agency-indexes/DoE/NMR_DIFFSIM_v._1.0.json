    "description": "The software generates and analyzes nuclear magnetic resonance spin diffusion simulations for the purpose of measuring domain sizes or spin diffusion constants in a heterogenous sample. Its primary capabilities are:\n1.\tIt solves the spin magnetization diffusion equation to simulate the results of a spin diffusion experiment using any structural input geometry, including structure models generated by molecular dynamics or other computational or experimental methods.\n2.\tIt compares the results of simulations on an input structure to experimental data, providing a data fitting algorithm to extract physical information from the experimental data via the simulation.\n3.\tIt can provide statistical measures to compare correlations between structural models, to determine domain clustering and connectedness, and to provide goodness-of-fit measures including chord length distributions, chi-squared values, Pearson coefficients and pair correlation functions.\n4.\tIt provides output reports, data files, and movies to visualize simulation results.\n",
