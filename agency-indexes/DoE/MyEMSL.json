    "description": "MyEMSL provides the following features: user-assisted upload of data from scientific instruments to an archive, tracking data though the upload process, providing metadata for recovery of uploaded data, providing users with access to the data. These features are supplied by a mixture of open source software and internally developed software. MyESML also provides a notification system that allows the system to communicate with users and other parts of the MyEMSL system. This allows the system to support automated workflows and user interaction. Reprocessing of already ingested data is also supported.",
