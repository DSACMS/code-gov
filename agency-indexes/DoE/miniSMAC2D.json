    "description": "In the drive to make exascale computing a reality, significant effort is being invested in efficiently implementing and improving current numerical algorithms on various vendors' newest testbeds acquired by DOE's Advanced Simulation and Computing program. Porting large-scale applications to these testbeds is prohibitive in labor and time. Instead, it is more advantageous to run small-scale programs that capture the essence of the large-scale application and that can be more easily modified, improved, and distributed to other collaborators focused on hardware/software co-design. These small-scale applications are called miniapps are are being developed under the aegis of the Mantevo project.",
