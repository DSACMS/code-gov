    "description": "Compiler optimizations can alter the numerical results of scientific computing applications. When numerical results differ significantly between compilers, optimization levels, and floating-point hardware, these numerical inconsistencies can impact programming productivity. Ciel is a framework that helps programmers identify locations in the source code that are affected by compiler optimizations in CPU and GPU code. Ciel uses a floating-point precision enhancement strategy, guided by a recursive bisection search algorithm with increasing search granularity, to identify the program expressions that induce numerical inconsistencies due to compiler optimizations.",
