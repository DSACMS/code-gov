    "description": "With this COUNT software, we can run a simple query on a campus's Wireless Local Area Network controller (WLAN controller) to obtain the number of connected devices per access point across the whole campus and this can be used as a proxy for the actual number of occupants in the campus. The software supports user defined functions to parse access point names to retrieve more information (e.g.: building names, room numbers etc.) and also allows post-processing of the data.",
