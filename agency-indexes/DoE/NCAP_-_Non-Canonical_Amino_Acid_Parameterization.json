    "description": "Our software is designed to only work on novel NCAA side chains and parameterize for the CHARMM potential. This works\naround the detailed analysis and manual parameter fitting of many existing software programs. Our approach is also more\nspecific than those used in Rosetta where we calculate parameters specific for each NCAA rather than assuming\ntransferability.",
