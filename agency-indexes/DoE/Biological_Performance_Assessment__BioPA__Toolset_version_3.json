    "description": "The Biological Performance Assessment (BioPA) version 3, uses computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and particle trajectory simulations of the hydro-turbine to quantify the exposure of passing fish to a set of known injury mechanisms. By appropriate sampling of the fluid domain, the BioPA assigns exposure probabilities to each mechanism. The exposure probabilities are combined with dose- response data from laboratory stress studies of fish to produce a set of biological BioPA Scores. These metrics provide an objective measure that can be used to compare competing turbines or to refine a new design.",
