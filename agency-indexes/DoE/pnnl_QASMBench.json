    "description": "A low-level OpenQASM benchmark suite for NISQ evaluation and simulation. Please see our paper for details.\nn this repository you will find a low-level and light-weighted benchmark suite based on IBM OpenQASM language (see spec). It collects commonly seen quantum algorithms and routines from various domains including chemistry, simulation, linear algebra, searching, optimization, arithmetic, machine learning, fault tolerance, cryptography, etc. QASMBench trades-off between generality and usability, covering the number of qubits ranging from 2 to 60K, and the circuit depth from 4 to 12M",
