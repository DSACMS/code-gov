    "description": "We have built a new framework that enables independent metadata updates within HDF5 files. Our framework includes the following components: an overlay network that's optimized for 1-to-All and All-to-All communication; root-less/server-less Bcast and AllReduce operations for reduced synchronization; a distributed consensus-making platform; an execution order keeping system, and a progress engine for generic threadless concurrence handling.",
