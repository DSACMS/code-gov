    "description": "GridAPPS-D provides a method for developers to run their new applications on a real-time simulator with extensive modeling and tool support. GridAPPS-D is built around standard data models like the CIM. It readily interfaces to existing software products, which may also 1) use components of GridAPPS-D and 2) supplement or replace the built-in distribution simulator, facilitating the deployment of new ADMS applications to existing software products.",
