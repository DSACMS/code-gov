    "description": "Deep neural network-based force field enables researchers to study materials systems of large size and/or time scale efficiently with comparable accuracy to DFT-based methods. However, such force fields, if improperly trained or mistakenly selected, could result in ill-conditioned results. This SBIR Phase I project has explored the possibility to characterize and index force fields in Deep potential theme by quantizing local atomic environments of atoms in a simulation system. This project has also demonstrated the feasibility of building a public accessible web infrastructure providing high quality machine learning algorithm-based force field for next generation materials modeling and simulation to accelerate the study and discovery of new energy-related materials.",
