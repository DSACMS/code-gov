    "description": "We develop a software called Physics-Preserved Graph Network (PPGN) to accurately locate faults at the node level with limited observability and labeled training data. PPGN has a unique two-stage graph neural network architecture. The first stage learns the graph embedding to represent the entire network using a few measured nodes. The second stage finds relations between the labeled and unlabeled data samples to further improve the location accuracy.",
