    "description": "Historically, codes for simulating supernovae (such as Arepo, FLASH or LEAFS) have been at the forefront of scientific high-performance computing to the immense computational resources required for full 3D simulations. However, given the shift towards heterogenous HPC architectures, many current-generation codes are at the risk of losing their competitiveness as they are only designed to run on homogeneous CPU-only systems. There exist several efforts to enable these codes for GPU\u2019s, however, these efforts only consider specific architectures or vendors (e.g., implement only CUDA or HIP), limiting themselves to a small range of exascale computing systems.\nFrameworks such as Kokkos aim to provide a framework which is agnostic of the targeted architecture, enabling the development of performant and portable code.\nIn the Ares code, we develop a performance portable tool to simulate supernovae based on the Parthenon Framework, which in turn uses Kokkos in the background. Here, the Parthenon Framework provides an interface to the underlying mesh-refinement routines, which form the backbone of our code. In addition, we incorporate the already existing Singularity-EOS toolkit to provide us with various equations of state, primarily the Helmholtz equation of state. We also include the JINA Reaclib as a basis for our nuclear network solver. Finally, we implement a gravity solver to complete the required physics.\nThis setup will provide us with a minimal code base to simulate supernova in a similar style to the tried-and-tested Arepo code, but in a futureproof performance portable framework.",
