    "description": "This is a prototype framework initially developed as part of an international consortium (aica-iwg.org/) for NATO ACT in 2021 under an LGPL license (Blakely/ANL did 100% of the coding). It is intended to serve as a reference model and collaborative project for researchers interested in working on self-defending software agents. It consists of a set of Docker containers that allow simulation of a network environment, including a manager agent that has capabilities for observing network activities, using automated decision making to select appropriate defensive/proactive actions, and putting those actions into practice. It is currently at an \"MVP\" level but we are continuing to add to this and have submitted a DHS S&T CAP proposal to build an open source community around it.",
