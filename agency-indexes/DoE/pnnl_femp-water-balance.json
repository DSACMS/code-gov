    "description": "Analysis and reporting for water and irrigation usage\nPNNL developed the Water Balance Tool, which provides a method to determine potable water consumption, by end-use, of a campus. A water balance compares the total water supply to the volume of water consumed by water-using equipment and applications. The output of the tool provides the estimated potable water consumption by major end-use and compares the sum of the end-uses to the total potable water supplied to the campus.",
