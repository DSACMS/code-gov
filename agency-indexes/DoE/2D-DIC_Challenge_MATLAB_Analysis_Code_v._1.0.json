    "description": "This code replicates the analysis completed in the published article (see reference below) for the 2D-DIC Challenge (https://sem.org/dic-challenge/), conducted under the auspices of the Society for Experimental Mechanics (SEM).  The purpose of the DIC Challenge is to provide a set of vetted and standard images, which all users and developers of Digital Image Correlation (DIC) software can use -DIC Challenge results from Sample 14 and Sample 15 of the DIC-Challenge images, and computes various statistics on the data, such as the noise, bias, and spatial resolution. \n\nP.L.
