    "description": "Whetstone is a deep learning software library for spiking/binary threshold neuromorphic hardware.  Built to integrate with Keras models, Whetstone provides a collection of layers, callbacks, and utility functions designed to allow the training of integrate-and-fire neurons rather than traditional analog activation functions (e.g. rectified linear units).  Generally, training a network for neuromorphic hardware is challenging due to the discontinuity of the activation function.  Whetstone overcomes this challenge by using ever-closer continuous approximations of a threshold activation, modified during training time.  This allows rapid and consistent training for ultra-low powered neuromorphic hardware.",
