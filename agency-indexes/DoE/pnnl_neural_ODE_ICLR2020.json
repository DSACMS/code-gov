    "description": "We show how to model discrete ordinary differential equations (ODE) with algebraic nonlinearities as deep neural networks with varying degrees of prior knowledge.\nWe derive the stability guarantees of the network layers based on the implicit constraints imposed on the weight's eigenvalues. Moreover, we show how to use barrier methods to generically handle additional inequality constraints.\nWe demonstrate the prediction accuracy of learned neural ODEs evaluated on open-loop simulations compared to ground truth dynamics with bi-linear terms.",
