    "description": "The Electricity Bill Calculator Library is a generic tool for manipulating the tariffs of electricity, with an emphasis on commercial Time-Of-Use (TOU) rates in the U.S. and residential Net Energy Metering tariffs in CA. Typical uses of the package are price signal generation and bill computation. To generate price signals from a specific tariff and given a time window, the tool creates a pandas dataframes containing the various components of the electricity charges, at each time step. This is particularly useful for Demand Response (DR) applications, such as price-based optimization of energy in buildings. The tool also computes bills given a building's power consumption and a specific tariff and returning the corresponding cost of electricity, as well as a breakdown per type of rate.",
