    "description": "A template system-of-systems modeling approach for\nautomating the development, deployment, and  integration of cooling system models (CSMs) for supercomputing facilities within the ExaDigiT framework.\n\nAutoCSM is a Python-based framework to assist in CSM developers in accelerating the creation and deployment of system-level thermal-hydraulic CSMs. The intention is for this tool specifically to help standardize digital twin workflows for ExaDigiT. However, this tool can be used independent of ExaDigiT (and even other systems besides CSMs).",
