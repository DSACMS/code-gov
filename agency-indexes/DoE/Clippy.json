    "description": "Clippy (CLI + PYthon) is a Python language interface to HPC resources. Precompiled binaries that execute on HPC systems are exposed as methods to a dynamically-created Clippy Python object, where they present a familiar interface to researchers, data scientists, and others. Clippy allows these users to interact with HPC resources in an easy, straightforward environment - at the REPL, for example, or within a notebook - without the need to learn complex HPC behavior and arcane job submission commands.",
