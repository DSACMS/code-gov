    "description": "A surprisingly non-trivial technical challenge is to associate points in space (e.g., GPS data) with specific segments of a road network or map. The software package ( allows users to match GPS point data to a road network (commonly known as \"map matching\"). The software is designed such that a user could match a set of GPS points to a variety of different road network representations using a variety of map matching algorithms. There are currently several \"built-in\" road networks and map matching algorithms but the software has been designed to enable new ones to be added with minimal overhead.",
