The DSOM package provides operators with the information they need for cost-effective operating decisions creating savings in fuel, personnel, maintenance, and plant life extension. DSOM provides operators real-time system performance information to allow them to determine if the plant is malfunctioning or running below expectations. By catching potential problems, DSOM enables plants to operate safely at peak efficiency, while providing a higher level of reliability and safety.",
