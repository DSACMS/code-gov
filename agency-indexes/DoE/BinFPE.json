    "description": "BinFPE is a tool that detects floating-point exceptions (NaN, infinity, and subnormal quantities) in NVIDIA GPU applications using binary instrumentation. It requires no re-compilation of the application and can analyze libraries. The tool extends NVBit (https://github.com/NVlabs/NVBit), which is provided by NVIDIA Labs to analyze binaries. When the tool detects a floating-point exception it reports to the user the location of the exception (file and line number).",
