    "description": "Pyranda Is fortran 90 code which solves compact finite difference equations on a three dimensional fortran arrays, domain decomposed using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). The fortran source solves the linear system of equations which forms a pentadtagona1 matrix. Derivatives are used to construct hyperbolic partlal differential equation (PDE) operators, namely gradient, divergence, Laplacian, and curl operators. \n5. Solution Method:\nThe library provides a python Interface which facilitates problem setup and description. However, the core solver Is written in the fortran 90 language. The solver couples MPI communication and linear solves together so that a direct (non-iterative) solution to the linear system of equations can be computed with minimal communication. Domain decomposition is limited to a uniform data size but provides perfect load balancing. \n6. Computer for which the code Is written:",
