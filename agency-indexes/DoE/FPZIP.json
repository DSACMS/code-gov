    "description": "fpzip is a C/C++ library for lossless and lossy compression of 1D, 2D, and 3D single- and double-precision floating-point arrays. \n\nAlthough designed for lossless compression, the user may optionally request lossy compression by specifying how many bits of precision per floating-point value to retain.\n\nFpzip supports streaming compression and decompression with either a memory buffer or a file as source or destination. \n\nIn addition to a simple C interface, fpzip comes with an executable for (de)compressing binary files.",
