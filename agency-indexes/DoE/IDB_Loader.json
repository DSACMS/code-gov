    "description": "SAND2024-08428O\nThe IDB Loader is a database designed to hold gamma spectra. IDB is a web-accessible database of reference gamma spectra for measuring uranium (U) and plutonium (Pu) isotopic composition. The database, developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), provides access to well-characterized groups of gamma spectra curated by international experts in gamma spectroscopy. It was created to promote sustainability and maintenance of software used to determine the isotopic abundances of U and Pu. The IDB Loader works by uploading one set of spectral data into an existing IDB. The Data Loader package includes documentation describing the IDB's table, the format of the spectral data, and a description of the loader program. The IDB is currently hosted by the IAEA at: https://nds.iaea.org/idb \nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
