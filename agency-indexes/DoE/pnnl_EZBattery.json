    "description": "Cell performance optimization is important for improving the system efficiency of a redox flow battery. To gain better insights into key controlling factors Of system efficiency, this work first proposed a theoretical model for a unit cell by extending a two-dimensional analytic model to a full cell. The model is then used for cell performance optimization after validating it with experimental and numerical modeling data.",
