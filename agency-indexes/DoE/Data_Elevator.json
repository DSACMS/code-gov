    "description": "Data Elavator allows extensive optimizations, such as overlapping read and write operations, choosing I/O modes, and aligning buffer boundaries. Is as much as 4.2X faster than Cray DataWarp, the start-of-art software for burst buffer, and 4X faster than directly writing to PFS.",
