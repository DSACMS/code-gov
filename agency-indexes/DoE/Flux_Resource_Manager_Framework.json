    "description": "First, note: flux framework, and the flux framework projects, are already released under GPLv2 and LGPLv2 for linkable components since roughly 2014. This request is to re-license the flux framework in full to LGPLv3 to better support vendor collaboration and allow use of external apache2 and similarly licensed libraries.\nflux is a framework for writing resource managers as well as a resource manager for HPC systems. It allows for hierarchical nesting and providing a portable interface for job scheduling across systems.",
