    "description": "The J-integral vs. crack growth resistance curve (J-R curve) is a useful tool for evaluating material fracture toughness in the ductile condition. A widely accepted practice for conducting tests to obtain J-R curves is ASTM standard E1820, in which the normalization method was introduced as an alternative method for determining the J-R curve. The normalization method requires solely force-displacement data, together with initial and final crack size measurements from a specimen to derive the J-R curve. Because of the elimination of the compliance measurement, the normalization method significantly simplifies testing requirements to obtain J-R curve. Despite these advantages, the analysis procedures of the normalization method are quite complicated to follow, which may limit the wide application of this method. To address this, we have developed a software with user-friendly graphic interface to perform automated normalization analysis. Any users, even without detailed knowledge of the normalization analysis, can use this software to derive J-R curves based on the ASTM E1820 normalization method.",
