    "description": "GeoPlace software solves several problems related to efficient sensor placement for remote sensing. It consists of several components. \u201cGeoFoot\u201d finds efficient locations for centering a set of camera images, in order to ensure that the collection of images contains an entire region. It is built on a modified version of \u201cSimple MPS\u201d. GeoSubFoot selects non-overlapping rectangular subregions of a single camera image, in order to devote more resources for higher-fidelity sub-images of those regions. The goal is for the rectangular subregions to contain many user-specified pixels of interest. Simple MPS is a generic program that produces point-sample distributions with blue noise characteristics over arbitrary-dimensional squares. GeoFoot includes an extension of it to sampling from polygons in 2d, including both the inside of the polygon and slightly outside it.",
