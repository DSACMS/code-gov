    "description": "SCEPTRE solves the linear Boltzmann transport equation for general one-, two- and three-dimensional unstructured-mesh Cartesian geometries. SCEPTRE can handle any particle type for which multigroup-Legendre cross sections are available. However, the code is designed primarily to model the transport of photons, electrons, and positrons through matter. SCEPTRE 2.0 includes several auxiliary packages for pre- and post-processing, regression testing, stochastic radiation transport, thermal radiation transport, and charged-particle transport in the presence of electromagnetic fields. SCEPTRE 2.0 includes sophisticated transport-synthetic acceleration and ray-effects mitigation capabilities.",
