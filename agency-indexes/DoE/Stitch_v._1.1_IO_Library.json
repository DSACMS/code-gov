    "description": "Stitch is a new IO library focused around supporting simulations where only a small portion of the simulation space changes at each timestep. It improves storage efficiency by only storing the changed data and constructs on request a view of an arbitrary region at a given time by stitching together parts of various outputs. This enables scaling from a single process to 100s of nodes. The earlier version performance of the library as the data size scaled was too slow. Changes were made to improve the performance by a factor of about 30x in the production applications. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
