    "description": "Pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) are crucial for nu- merous applications in HPC ranging from molecular dynamics to quantum chemistry, and hydrodynamics. Our optimized implementation generates the same random number sequence as the original well-characterized MRG8. MRG8-AVX512 achieves a substantial 69% improvement compared to Intel's MKL, and MRG8-GPU shows a maximum 3.36x speedup compared to NVIDIA's cuRAND library.",
