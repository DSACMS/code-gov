    "description": "PsDNS is a Python package which makes it easy to solve partial differential equation using a pseudo-spectral method. The code uses Python classes and Numpy-like arrays to provide a simple interface with which users can construct equations, integrators, and diagnostics. It also includes implementation for common problems, in particular, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation in a periodic domain, which is commonly used as a benchmark problem for turbulence research. PsDNS uses MPI to allow massively parallel computation for large problems.",
