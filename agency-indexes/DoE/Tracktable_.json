    "description": "Tracktable is a toolkit for analysis and visualization of the trajectories of moving objects.  Its main focus is on air and sea traffic.  It can also work with more abstract trajectories such as eye tracking data.   We supply a set of core data structures, input/output routines, math and machine learning algorithms that operate on those data structures, and visualization algorithms to produce movies and still images of the results.\n",
