    "description": "PyApprox provides flexible and efficient tools for high-dimensional approximation and uncertainty quantification. PyApprox implements methods addressing various issues surrounding high-dimensional parameter spaces and limited evaluations of expensive simulation models with the goal of facilitating simulation-aided knowledge discovery, prediction and design. Tools are provided for: (i) building surrogates using polynomial chaos expansions using least squares, compressive sensing and interpolation; (ii) sparse grid interpolation and quadrature; (iii) low-rank tensor-decompositions; (iv) multi-fidelity approximation and sampling; (v) large-scale Bayesian inference; (vi) numerical solvers for canonical ordinary and partial differential equations useful for demonstration purposes; compressive sensing solvers (vii) and (viii) visualization. The code is intended to as a python toolbox but provides c++ code with Python interfaces to computationally expensive algorithms to increase performance.
