    "description": "The multimat_1drdg code is a one-dimensional code which is used to prototype the numerical method published in \u201cPandare, A. K., Waltz, J., & Bakosi, J. (2019). A Reconstructed Discontinuous Galerkin method for Multi-Material Hydrodynamics with Sharp-Interfaces. International Journal for Numerical Methods in Fluids.\u201d It solves the multi-fluid dynamics equations (arbitrary number of fluids) using the third-order Reconstructed Discontinuous Galerkin (rDG) method. A few academic test problems from previous published literature are included as initial setup options.",
