    "description": "OPFLearn.jl is a Julia package for creating datasets for machine learning approaches to solving AC optimal power flow (AC OPF). It was developed to provide researchers with a standardized way to efficiently create AC OPF datasets that are representative of more of the AC OPF feasible load space compared to typical dataset creation methods. The OPFLearn dataset creation method uses a relaxed AC OPF formulation to reduce the volume of the unclassified input space throughout the dataset creation process. Over time this input space tightens around the relaxed AC OPF feasible region to increase the percentage of feasible load profiles found while uniformly sampling the input space. Load samples are processed using AC OPF formulations from PowerModels.jl. More information on the dataset creation method can be found in our publication, \"OPF-Learn: An Open-Source Framework for Creating Representative AC Optimal Power Flow Datasets\". To use OPFLearn.jl a PowerModels network data dictionary is required (can be loaded from Matpower \".m\" files) to define the network the dataset is being created for.",
