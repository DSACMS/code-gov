    "description": "Non-encrypted, TCP-streams, host-to-host file copy utility intended to enable greater transfer rates, while having the basic user-interface concept of BSD rcp. The underlying design provides the opportunity to maximize performance by allocating supplemental IP sockets as dedicated and optimizable data-channels, in a mode similar to FTP. Additionally, a parallel I/O scheme, based on the HPSS paradigm, is also employed, offering potentials for multiple-sockets over a single network connection (which, in many circumstances, especially those in involving heterogeneous host platforms, or large latency situations, can capture more bandwidth), and also the distribution of the sockets across a manifold of parallel IP network connections.",
