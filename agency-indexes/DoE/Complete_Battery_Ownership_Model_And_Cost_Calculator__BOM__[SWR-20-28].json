    "description": "This software is an advanced TCO calculator that takes into account various scenarios of vehicle and component costs, battery and fuel price forecasts, drive patterns, battery wear, charging infrastructure costs, purchase incentives, financing, ownership, and other criteria. The vehicle economics considered include vehicle and related infrastructure purchases, financing, fuel (gasoline and electricity) costs, non-fuel operating and maintenance costs, battery replacement, salvage value, and any costs passed on by a third party such as a service provider to account for the installation, use, and availability of infrastructure. Battery degradation, charging strategies, and drive patterns play an important role in each of these elements.",
