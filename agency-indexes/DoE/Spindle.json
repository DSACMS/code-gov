    "description": "Spindle is software infrastructure that solves file system scalability problems associated with starting dynamically linked applications in HPC environments. When an HPC applications starts up thousands of processes at once, and those processes simultaneously access a shared file system to look for shared libraries, it can cause significant performance problems for both the application and other users. Spindle scalably coordinates the distribution of shared libraries to an application to avoid hammering the shared file system.",
