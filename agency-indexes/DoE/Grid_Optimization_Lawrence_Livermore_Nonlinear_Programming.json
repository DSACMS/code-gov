    "description": "Modelling and solution library for security-constrained AC optimal power flow problems that uses nonlinear programming methods (interior-point methods) and solvers (Ipopt, HiOp). The code is written in C++ and provides parallel computing capabilities in the form of task parallelism (solving contingency problems in parallel). Code can run on a variety of commodity high-performance computing.",
