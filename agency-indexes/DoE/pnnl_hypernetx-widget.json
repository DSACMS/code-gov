    "description": "Hnx-widget is a Jupyter notebook widget for visualizing hyper graphs that is intended to work in conjunction with the HyperNetX open source package developed by PNNL. It renders hyper graphs using Euler diagrams (a Venn diagram is a special type of Euler diagram). The tool contains simple interactions that allow the user to select nodes and change their appearance. It scales to small to medium sized (100 node) hyper graphs",
