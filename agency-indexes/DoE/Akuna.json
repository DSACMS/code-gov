    "description": "Akuna is a user environment that enables geoscientists to create conceptual models for subsurface investigations. These conceptual models can be augmented to create numerical models for specific subsurface simulators, and Akuna enables these simulations to be executed on supercomputers, and the results analyzed and visualized. Akuna is designed to easily support multiple subsurface simulators by using a novel, declarative approach that describes the specific features (input file formats, execution modes, output formats) of a simulator in an external data file, based on this data file, Akuna user interfaces are dynamically generated by Akuna, greatly reducing the effort and cost required to support a new simulator.",
