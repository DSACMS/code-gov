    "description": "The Data Import Manager is a part of PRISM, the Proteomics Research Information and Management System. The Data Import Manager monitors a central folder for new dataset trigger files, which are XML files that specify metadata for new datasets to import into the Data Management System (DMS). The Data Import Manager validates the metadata in the XML trigger file, notifying the instrument operator by e-mail if invalid metadata is encountered. After processing each XML trigger file, the file is moved into either a success or failure folder.",
