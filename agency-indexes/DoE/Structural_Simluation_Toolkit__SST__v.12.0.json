    "description": "The Structural Simulation Toolkit (SST) was developed to explore innovations in highly concurrent computing systems where the instruction set architecture (ISA), micro-architecture, and memory interact with the programming model and communications system. The package provides a fully modular design for extensive exploration of an individual system parameter as well as a parallel simulation environment based on message passing interface (MPI) which enable a high level of performance as well as the ability to look at large systems. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
