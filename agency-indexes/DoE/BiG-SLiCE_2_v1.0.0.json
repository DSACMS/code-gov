    "description": "BiG-SLiCE was originally an open source Python-based command line bioinformatics software that offers a highly scalable clustering analysis on biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) data. It allows a simultaneous analysis of millions of BGCs, exceeding the capability of other existing tools (around one hundred thousands). As a tradeoff, the clustering accuracy is relatively lower and sometimes fall short in corner cases and specific BGC classes such as the RiPPs (Ribosomally-translated, Post-translationally modified Peptides).\n\nIn BiG-SLiCE V2 (developed in LBNL), the clustering algorithm has been significantly improved to deliver a much accurate result even for RiPPs and other previous corner case classes. Moreover, the speed of the overall pipeline has been improved by 50-100%. Finally, additional features were implemented to support downstream analyses of BiG-SLiCE results, such as customized tabular (TSV/CSV) and columnar (Parquet) outputs.",
