    "description": "ROMPIO is a software-based test designed to measure MPI collective, independent, asynchronous, and POSIX file I/O performance, synthesizing how applications utilize file systems in the LANL ASC computing environment. File layouts include N processors to N files and N processors to 1 file. Write access patterns include non-strided and strided. Pure network performance measure can also be obtained for relevant MPI collective calls.",
