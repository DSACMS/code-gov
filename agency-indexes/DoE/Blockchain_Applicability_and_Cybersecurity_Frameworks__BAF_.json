    "description": "The Blockchain Applicability and Cybersecurity Frameworks is the implementation of an earlier invention disclosure and Provisional Patent Application:  S-146,805, Battelle IPID 31608-E.  \u2014BAF walks a user (or an interested party) through ~100 controls to determine various factors, including:\n1. Does the application need a blockchain?\n2. If the application needs a blockchain, does it need a private blockchain or permissionless/public blockchain?\n3. What kind of consensus is most suitable for the application? The current version of BAF evaluates between four consensus mechanisms: proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, proof-of-burn, and proof-of-authority.",
