    "description": "The Grand Unified File Index (GUFI) is an index that holds file-system metadata (i.e. filenames, access and creation dates, file attributes, extended attributes, etc.) pulled from huge file/data storage-systems using full and incremental index update, allowing rapid searches that don\u2019t have to impact the file-systems themselves, supporting both users and system/data managers.  GUFI is a very fast software solution that offers speed and security, while minimizing impact on supercomputing resources. ",
