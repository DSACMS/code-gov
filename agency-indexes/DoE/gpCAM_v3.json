    "description": "A central goal in experimental science is to explore and understand the composition-processing-structure-property relations of materials in their associated multi-dimensional parameter spaces, These parameter spaces can be thought of as the set of all conceivable combinations of the parameters affecting an experiment, including synthesis and processing conditions, material composition, and environmental conditions during the experiment. gpCAM analyzes data to steer the experiment. The software tool creates a surrogate model and associated uncertainties by performing a Gaussian process regression. Mathematical function optimization is then used to find measurements of maximum value.",
