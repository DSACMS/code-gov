    "description": "This Git repository contains codes for the 'Graph Learning in Physical-informed Mesh-reduced Space for Real-world Dynamic Systems' paper that will be published in 2023 SIGKDD. This work uses physical-informed prior (PiP) information to learn and predict fluid dynamics in a reduced mesh space. We propose a two-stage graph-based model for fluid velocity field reconstruction and prediction. In the first stage, we learn a subgraph autoencoder to summarize the information in a mesh-reduced space using physical-informed priors. In the second stage, we learn a dynamics predictor to predict subgraph evolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on two fluid flow datasets: lid-driven cavity flow data and cylinder flow data. This code is also applicable for any other dynamic systems with corresponding data.",
