    "description": "This open-source tool implements Circular Economy metrics for photovoltaic (PV) materials. It can be used to quantify and assign a value framework to efforts on re-design, reduction, replacement, reuse, recycling, and lifetime and reliability increases in the PV value chain.\n\nThe PV_ICE is leveraging published data from different sources on PV manufacturing and predicted technological changes. Input data is being compiled here\n\nThis tool will help implement circularity metrics, quantify and assign a value framework to efforts on re-design, reduction, replacement, reusage, recycling, and lifetime and reliability increases on PV.",
