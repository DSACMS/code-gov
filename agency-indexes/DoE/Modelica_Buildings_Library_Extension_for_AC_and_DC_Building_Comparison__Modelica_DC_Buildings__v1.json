    "description": "This software simulates and compares the losses in AC and DC buildings. It uses formatted load profile data from EnergyPlus, PV generation data from PVWatts, realistic converter efficiency curves based on product data, a battery controller based on excess PV, and a realistic wire model. The software includes Modelica code, which is an extension of the Buildings Library Electrical models. It also includes Python code, which manages the Modelica parametric simulations and plots results.",
