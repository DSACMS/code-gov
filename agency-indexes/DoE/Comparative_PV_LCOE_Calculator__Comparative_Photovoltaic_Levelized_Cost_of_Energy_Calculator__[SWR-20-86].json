    "description": "The calculator calculates levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for photovoltaic (PV) systems based on cost, performance, and reliability inputs for a baseline and a proposed technology. The user can choose inputs and watch the effect on LCOE to determine whether a proposed technology is cost-effective, perform trade-off analysis among different technology options, and do break-even analysis of cost or performance.",
