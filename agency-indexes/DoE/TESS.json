    "description": "Computing a Voronoi or Delaunay tessellation from a set of points is a core part of the analysis of many simulated and measured datasets. As the scale of simulations and observations surpasses billions of particles, a distributed-memory scalable parallel algorithm is the only feasible approach. The primary contribution of this software is a distributed-memory parallel Delaunay and Voronoi tessellation algorithm based on existing serial computational geometry libraries that automatically determines which neighbor points need to be exchanged among the subdomains of a spatial decomposition. Other contributions include the addition of periodic and wall boundary conditions.",
