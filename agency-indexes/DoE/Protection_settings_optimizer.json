    "description": "SAND2023-06672O\nThe Protection Settings Optimizer (PSO) uses system and fault data as inputs to formulate the problem of calculating relay settings as a mixed integer, nonlinear optimization problem (MINLP). The MINLP is solved using a genetic algorithm-based optimizer that attempts to find settings to reduce the relay operating times. \n\nThe PSO protects the power system by using the steady-state fault voltages and currents, which then calculates the optimal device setting to protect the power system.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
