    "description": "High-Throughput software platform to create/launch/analyze physics-related calculations. The front-end is a python API which allows the user to create any conceivable first-principles physics calculation. Is is coupled to an ipython interface to launch and retrieve large number of calculations. It was successfully used in high-throughput calculations of point defect formation enthalpies, compound formation enthalpies, and a genetic algorithm search of direct-gap silicon/germanium structures.",
