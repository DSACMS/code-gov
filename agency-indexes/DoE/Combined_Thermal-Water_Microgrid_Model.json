    "description": "SAND2022-3874 O\nThe Combined Thermal-Water Microgrid Model is a set of three models combined with controls algorithms for a Water Thermal Storage (WTS), Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP), and Thermal Bridge Loop (TBL) that serves a residential neighborhood. The model allows a parametric investigation of volume of water storage versus number of ground heat exchanger bore-holes versus seasonal energy efficiency measures. The code is being released as open source so that the entire study can be replicated per an open access journal publication. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
