    "description": "Sub-Regional Nexus Modeling\nMetis provides a framework allowing analysis of dynamics across multiple sectors including energy, water, land and socioeconomics at variable spatial and temporal scales. It is designed to be a flexible tool which can take inputs from both global integrated assessment models (IAMs) which capture global dynamics as well as more detailed models which capture specific sub-regional and sectoral details at finer resolutions. Metis integrates across tools by sharing data in standardized formats.",
