    "description": "The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has developed a data acquisition system to support laboratory (component) and in-water validation and testing of Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) technologies. The Modular Ocean Data AcQuisition System (MODAQ) is a robust system built on industrial grade hardware that can acquire high-quality and summary data from many sensor and instrument types. MODAQ includes modules to perform real-time QC screening, system health monitoring, and send alerts. MODAQ is also part of a larger data management, processing, visualization, and archiving system.",
