    "description": "This software is used with a microcontroller to control an aerosol jet printing system. It was written for a 32-bit ARM microcontroller, providing greater processing speed and complexity relative to more conventional low-cost printer controllers. The microcontroller software was written using a real-time operating system (FreeRTOS), which simplifies parallel operation of multiple functions and further customization. It supports simultaneous motion planning, pulse generation for stepper motors, reading encoder feedback, communicating with multiple mass flow controllers, controlling solid state relays, handling a software-based emergency stop, and sending data to the client PC. The program is written in C and communicates with the client PC via USB connection. Sandia National Laboratories is a multi-mission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.\nSAND2021-0436 O",
