ONCat consists of an API with which various software clients can communicate to gain access to that information, as well as a web site (see landing page) which offers a way for experiment teams and instrument staff to easily view the metadata relating to experiments using just a web browser. The code is currently private and closed-source. Please contact oncat-support@ornl.gov for more information.",
