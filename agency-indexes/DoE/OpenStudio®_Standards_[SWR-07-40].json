    "description": "OpenStudio\u00ae Standards is a Ruby Gem library that extends the OpenStudio SDK. It has four main use-cases:\n\nProvide higher level methods to help BEM users and developers to create OpenStudio models from existing geometry, or programmatically generated geometry\nCreate typical building models in OpenStudio format\nCreate a code baseline model from a proposed model\nCheck a model against a code/standard\nopenstudio-standards previously supported making the DOE/PNNL prototype buildings in OpenStudio format. This has since been deprecated, as the DOE/PNNL prototypes are intended for specific code comparisons under the Energy Policy Act and are not intended to accurately represent typical existing or new buildings. While openstudio-standards still creates typical buildings, these are not the same as the DOE/PNNL prototypes.",
