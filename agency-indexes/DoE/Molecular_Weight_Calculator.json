    "description": "This program can calculate the molecular weight and percent composition of chemical formulas and amino acids, providing a graphical user interface to edit the formulas and parsing options.  It recognizes user-definable abbreviations, custom elemental isotopes, and can display up to 20 compounds simultaneously.  It also includes a Mole/Mass Converter, Formula Finder, Capillary Flow Modeller, Amino Acid Notation Converter, Peptide Sequence Fragmentation Modeler, Isotopic Distribution Calculator, and built-in calculator.  Full program documentation is available by pressing F1 during program operation.",
