    "description": "This software can be used to tune the HPC operations of a Cray system running Slurm workload manager software. This includes many of the customizations that NERSC has made over the past three years. In particular these customizations allow for complex site-local policies to be implemented and managed in a scalable way, or add unique capabilities to slurm via our plugins, including: * performance software integration and compute node staging * temporary directory/dynamic user content management automation * software defined networking integration",
