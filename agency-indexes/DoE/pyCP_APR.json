    "description": "pyCP_APR is a tensor decomposition and anomaly detection Python library that is designed for the fast analysis of large datasets by accelerating computation speed using GPUs.  pyCP_APR uses the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) tensor factorization algorithm utilizing both Numpy and PyTorch backend. While the Numpy backend can be used for the analysis of both sparse and dense tensors, the PyTorch backend provides a faster decomposition of large and sparse tensors on the GPU. pyCP_APR's Scikit-learn like API allows comfortable interaction with the library, and includes the methods for statistical anomaly detection via the p-values obtained from the CP-APR factorization.",
