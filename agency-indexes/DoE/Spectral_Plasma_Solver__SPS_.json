    "description": "This is a framework for the solution of the Vlasov-Maxwell equations that describe the dynamics of charged particles (plasmas) and electromagnetic fields at the microscopic (kinetic) level. These equations represent a very fundamental mathematical model of plasmas and are commonly used in plasma physics for a variety of problems.",
