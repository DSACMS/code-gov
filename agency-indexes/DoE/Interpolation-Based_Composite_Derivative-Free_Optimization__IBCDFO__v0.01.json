    "description": "ICDFO is python and matlab/octave code for a set of for interpolation-based optimization methods for composite derivative-free optimization. These methods are applicable when a user wishes to maximize or minimize a function that depends on some blackbox component/simulation for which derivatives with respect to the decision variables are not available. The methods include pounders and goombah.",
