    "description": "TRITON is a 2D hydraulic, digital elevation model (DEM)-based model that accepts a variety of flow inputs including point-based inflow hydrographs, external boundary conditions, and runoff (i.e., excess rainfall). It provides information of flood maps and temporal evolution of water depth at each grid cell point at user-specified output time. Its unique feature is that TRITON can run on single or multiple CPUs and GPUs, proving to be very flexible in terms of system architecture.",
