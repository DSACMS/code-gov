    "description": "LLNL HPC systems run a custom version of RedHat's RHEL operating system known as TOSS. In 2022, after working with DISA, Livermore Computing staff completed the STIG (Security Technical Implementation Guide) for the TOSS 4 operating system. This software project contains the source code associated with that STIG and implements checks and remediations for configuring a system in compliance with that STIG.",
