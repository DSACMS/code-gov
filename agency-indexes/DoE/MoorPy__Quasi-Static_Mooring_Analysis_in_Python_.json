    "description": "MoorPy is a quasi-static mooring model and a suite of associated functions for mooring system analysis. The core model supports quasi-static analysis of moored floating systems including any arrangement of mooring lines and floating platforms. It solves the distributed position and tension of each mooring line segment using standard catenary equations. Floating platforms can be represented with linear hydrostatic characteristics. MoorPy automatically computes a floating system's equilibrium state and can be queried to identify a mooring system's nonlinear force-displacement relationships. Linearized stiffness matrices are efficiently computed using semi-analytic Jacobians. MoorPy also includes plotting functions and a library of mooring component property and cost coefficients. MoorPy can be used directly from Python scripts to perform mooring design and analysis tasks, or it can be coupled with other tools to compute quasi-static mooring reactions as part of a larger simulation.",
