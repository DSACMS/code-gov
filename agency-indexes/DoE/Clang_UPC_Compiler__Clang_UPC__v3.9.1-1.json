    "description": "Clang Unified Parallel C (Clang UPC) provides a compilation and execution environment for programs written in the UPC (Unified Parallel C) language. The Clang UPC compiler extends the capabilities of the Clang LLVM C compiler to comply with the UPC Language Specification version 1.3. It includes support for UPC collectives and a configurable pointer-to-shared representation. The compiler generates programs that run on a wide variety of systems ranging from workstations to leadership-class supercomputers, in conjunction with the Berkeley UPC runtime and GASNet communication system. This compiler generates assembly code / object code directly for Intel processors and IBM PowerPC.",
