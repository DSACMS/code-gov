    "description": "(DG)2 is an impact analysis tool for electrical utilities to perform spatio-temporal analysis with solar and battery energy storage systems. The purpose of the tool is to help distribution utilities with identifying impacts and costs associated with locating a MW-scale solar farm and energy storage system at a certain location over other choices. This tool also assists utilities to assess the amount of reverse power flow at the transmission lines.",
