    "description": "Laika BOSS (Binary Object Scanning System), often written as \"Laikaboss\", is an object scanner and intrusion detection system that strives to be scalable, flexible, and verbose. Its goal is to take arbitrary file input and extract all relevant subfiles and metadata for use in helping analysts determine the function and maliciousness of a file at a glance. This is an extension to the original code developed by Lockheed Martin.",
