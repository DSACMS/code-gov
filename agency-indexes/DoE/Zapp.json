    "description": "This code package computes the multi-species BGK kinetic model of Haack, Hauck, and Murillo [J. Stat. Phys., 168, 2017]. It uses a block adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework derived from the open-source, Parthenon performance portable AMR framework to provide refinement in the (up to) six dimensional phase space. It includes an atomic ionization model, accurate collision physics across coupling regimes, self-consistent electric fields, and allows for degeneracy in the electronic screening. This kinetic model greatly extends the temperature regime and the spatiotemporal scales for modeling moderately coupled plasmas.",
