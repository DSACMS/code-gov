    "description": "MRNet is a software tree-based overlay network developed at the University of Wisconsin, Madison that provides a scalable communication mechanism for parallel tools. MRNet, uses a tree topology of networked processes between a user tool and distributed tool daemons. This tree topology allows scalable multicast communication from the tool to the daemons. The internal nodes of the tree can be used to distribute computation and alalysis on data sent from the tool daemons to the tool. This release covers minor implementation to port this software to the BlueGene/L architecuture and for use with a new implementation of the Dynamic Probe Class Library.",
