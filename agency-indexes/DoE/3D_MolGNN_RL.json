    "description": "3D-MolGNNRL, couples reinforcement learning (RL) to a deep\ngenerative model based on 3D-Scaffold to generate target candidates specific to a protein pocket building up atom by\natom from the core scaffold. 3D-MolGNNRL provides an efficient way to optimize key features within a protein pocket using\na parallel graph neural network model. The agent learns to build molecules in 3D space while optimizing the binding\naffinity, potency, and synthetic accessibility of the candidates generated for the SARS-CoV-2 Main protease",
