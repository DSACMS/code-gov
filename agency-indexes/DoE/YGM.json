    "description": "YGM provides a simplified distributed memory communication framework based on a mailbox abstraction for HPC applications. YGM is designed for irregular data-driven applications that communicate small message payloads in an all-to-all fashion. YGM aggregates and routes messages into larger payloads to gain greater bandwidth utilization on modern HPC interconnects. YGM has been demonstrated up to 131k cores of IBM BG/P Sequoia and 96k cores of Catalyst at LLNL, and contains a set of graph-inspired benchmarks.",
