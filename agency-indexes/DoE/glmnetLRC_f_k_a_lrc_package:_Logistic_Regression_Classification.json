    "description": "Methods for fitting and predicting logistic regression classifiers (LRC) with an arbitrary loss function using elastic net or best subsets. This package adds additional model fitting features to the existing glmnet and bestglm R packages. This package was created to perform the analyses described in Amidan BG, Orton DJ, LaMarche BL, et al. 2014. Signatures for Mass Spectrometry Data Quality. Journal of Proteome Research. 13(4), 2215-2222. It makes the model fitting available in the glmnet and bestglm packages more general by identifying optimal model parameters via cross validation with an customizable loss function. It also identifies the optimal threshold for binary classification.",
