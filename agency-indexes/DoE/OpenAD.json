    "description": "OpenAD is a tool for automatic differentiation (AD) of C/C++ numerical computer programs. For the C/C++ side the entire pipeline is encapsulated in single binary. While the C/C++ tool incarnation shares components with OpenAD its development is a separate effort and it was decided to retain for it the name \"ADIC\" which goes back to the previous generation of tools.
