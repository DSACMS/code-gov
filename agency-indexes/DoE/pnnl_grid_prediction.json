    "description": "Two datadriven predictive approaches, namely, {\\em Koopman Operator Theoretic (KOT)-based} model and {\\em Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based model}, to enable effective power system state predictions. The KOT-based approaches (Robust\nDMD, deepDMD) capture the power system evolution as a linear dynamical system on an abstract space. The GNNs model the spatio-temporal correlations using graph convolutional network and are called Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (STGCN). These predictive models are trained, tested and compared rigorously based on their predictions of frequencies in the IEEE 68 bus system when subjected to a disturbance. GridSTAGE framework developed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is leveraged to generate multiple datasets (in the form of PMU measurements) for training and testing by strategically creating load changes across the spatial locations of the network",
