    "description": "SUPES is a collection of subprograms that perform frequently used non-numerical services for the engineering applications programmer. The three functional categories of SUPES are: (1) input command parsing, (2) dynamic memory management, and (3) system dependent utilities. The subprograms in categories one and two are written in standard FORTRAN-77, while the subprograms in category three are written provide a standardized FORTRAN interface to several system dependent features.",
