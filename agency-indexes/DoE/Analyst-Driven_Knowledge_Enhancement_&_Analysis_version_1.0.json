    "description": "AKEA provides tools for the creation, maintenance, visualization, and analysis of information expressed in semantic graph form. It is capable of taking information expressed in unstructured text documents or structured data documents (e.g., spreadsheets, databases), ingesting it and extracting entities and relationships of interest, then presenting said information in graphical form. In addition, it contains tools for applying traditional social network analysis algorithms to the generated graphs in order to identify key players or entities with particular characteristics, geospatial and temporal visualization of said data, and user-controlled storage of information to support future analysis needs.",
