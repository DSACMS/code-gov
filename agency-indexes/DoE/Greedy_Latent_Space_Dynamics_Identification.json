    "description": "This is a variant of LaSDI where it minimizes both reconstruction loss terms of auto encoder and dynamics regression loss terms simultaneously. Plus, an active learning framework is adopted so that a physics-informed greedy sampling point can be added to enhance the performance of gLaSDI. It is written in python and several examples are included in this software.",
