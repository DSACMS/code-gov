    "description": "The REopt\u00ae techno-economic decision support platform is used by NREL researchers to optimize energy systems for buildings, campuses, communities, microgrids, and more. REopt recommends the optimal mix of renewable energy, conventional generation, and energy storage technologies to meet cost savings, resilience, emissions reductions, and energy performance goals. The REopt\u00ae model provides concurrent, multiple technology integration and optimization capabilities to help organizations meet their cost savings and energy performance goals. Formulated as a mixed integer linear program, the REopt model recommends an optimally sized mix of renewable energy, conventional generation, and energy storage technologies; estimates the net present value of implementing those technologies; and provides a dispatch strategy for operating the technology mix at maximum economic efficiency. The REopt model was initially created to identify and prioritize cost-effective renewable energy projects across a portfolio of sites. The model is now also used to optimize the size and operating strategy of microgrids, storage, and energy/water systems.",
