    "description": "COMMON is a tool for collecting, storing, and displaying critical information to facilitate analysis on Microsoft Windows based IT systems. COMMON was developed to provide insight into the IT infrastructure for operational radiation detection systems, but is applicable to most Windows-based operating systems and TCP/IP network components. The COMMON tool aggregates a host of important Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) information and as well as network ping responses to provide valuable insight into the performance of the IT system. A unique feature is the creation of daily output files (JSON) from the data collected for off site evaluation by subject matter experts.",
