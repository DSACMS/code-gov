    "description": "This is a JavaScript library for a storyline layout\nalgorithm. Storylines are adept at communicating\ncomplex change by encoding time on the x-axis and\nusing the proximity of lines in the y direction to\nrepresent interaction between entities. The library in\nthis disclosure takes as input a list of objects\ncontaining an id, time, and state. The output is a\ndata structure that can be used to conveniently\nrender a storyline visualization. Most importantly, the\nlibrary computes the y-coordinate of the entities over\ntime that decreases layout artifacts including\ncrossings, wiggles, and whitespace. This is\naccomplished through multi-objective, multi-stage\noptimization problem, where the output of one stage\nproduces input and constraints for the next stage.",
