    "description": "Unit operations for the MSW sorting process include shredding, magnets for ferrous separation, screening, air classification, eddy current for non-ferrous separation, and near-infrared detection for plastic recovery. The MIXCINC module within Aspen Plus was selected to handle mixed solid streams containing inert (metals and glass) and non-conventional materials (paper, plastics, biomass, organic waste). The Peng-Robinson equation of state with Boston-Mathias modifications was applied to predict properties for a nonconventional solids mix. Enthalpy and density of the non-conventional materials were defined using non-conventional material properties.",
