    "description": "FireWorks is a free, open-source code for defining, managing, and executing workflows. Complex workflows can be defined using Python, JSON, or YAML, are stored using MongoDB, and can be monitored through a built-in web interface. Workflow execution can be automated over arbitrary computing resources, including those that have a queueing system. FireWorks has been used to run millions of workflows encompassing tens of millions of CPU-hours across diverse application areas and in long-term production projects over the span of multiple years.",
