    "description": "SAND2025-00929O\nVessel Integrated Turbine Assessment for LCOE (VITAL) is a user-friendly software tool that optimizes the design and control of hydrokinetic turbines deployed from floating vessels. It uses data about rotor blade performance, vessel parameters, tidal data, and cost models. This data is used to determine the best turbine design and control strategies to minimize the levelized cost of energy (LCOE). This application can enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of tidal energy projects.  Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
