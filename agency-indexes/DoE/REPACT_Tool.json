    "description": "Reuse of Existing Pipelines for Adapted Carbon Transport (REPACT) is an Excel-based screening tool. This tool enables the user to determine whether a pipeline originally deployed for natural gas transport, can be reused for CO2 transport. The tool along with its associated user's manual walk through an intended usage statement, setup instructions, a list of inputs and outputs in the tool, and frequently used protocols. Please note that this is a first-pass screening tool. The approach presented within this tool is valid for high-level evaluation only and should not be used to make engineering, financial, and/or regulatory decisions.
