    "description": "PV TOMCAT predicts the outdoor operating temperature and output power of a PV module based on measured physical properties and outdoor conditions. It includes a ray tracing model of a PV module, which runs in the commercial SunSolve ray tracer. Output from this model is combined with meteorological time series data to produce a combined input file for a finite-element model of heat conduction and radiation. Finally, this finite-element model is run in the commercial COMSOL Multiphysics software, producing time series outputs of temperature and power.",
