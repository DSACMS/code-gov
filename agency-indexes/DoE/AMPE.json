    "description": "AMPE is a phase-field code. It evolves in time the Allen-Cahn equations associated with a phase\u00adfield model, coupled with the time-evolution of a composition field (in an alloy) and a temperature field which are described by diffusion equations. It can also solve the elasticity equations assuming mechanical equilibrium at every time-step. Grain orientations are described by normalized quaternions which also evolve in time according to Allen-Cahn type equations. ",
