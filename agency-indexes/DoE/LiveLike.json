    "description": "This package is part of the Likeness Python toolkit, which generates high-fidelity synthetic populations for human dynamics modeling. The LiveLike package provides a high-level wrapper for generating synthetic populations via Census APIs based on the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates. Synthetic populations are virtual representations of people and households produced for small census areas (block groups, tracts) and can be attributed by a variety of demographic, economic, social, worker, student, mobility, housing, health, and communication characteristics found in the ACS.",
