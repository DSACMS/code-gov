    "description": "OpenMC is an open source, community-developed framework for performing Monte Carlo particle transport calculations.It is capable of simulating neutron and photon transport below ~50 MeV and also includes a model for bremsstrahlung\nproduction of photons by electrons/positrons. Fixed source, k-eigenvalue, and subcritical multiplication problems can be\nsolved. Problem geometries can be modeled either using constructive solid geometry or a CAD representation. A flexible and efficient tally system enables a wide variety of physical quantities to be tallied and analyzed. OpenMC can run in\nparallel using a hybrid MPI and OpenMP programming model and has been extensively tested on leadership class supercomputers. A built-in Bateman equation solver enables the modeling of material composition changes due to\nirradiation. One of the unique features of OpenMC is its rich, extensible Python and C/C++ programming interfaces that enable programming pre- and post-processing, multigroup cross section generation, workflow automation, multiphysics\ncoupling, and the visualization of geometry and tally results. In addition to the core Monte Carlo transport solver and associated APIs, OpenMC includes a Python-based nuclear data interface that enables power users to inspect, modify,and perform various types of nuclear data processing on ENDF, ACE, and OpenMC\u00bfs native HDF5 files",
