    "description": "Caffeine is the CoArray Fortran Framework of Efficient Interfaces to Network Environments. Caffeine aims to produce a parallel runtime library that will support Fortran compilers with a programming-model-agnostic application binary interface (ABI) to various lower-level communication libraries. The current version of Caffeine uses the GASNet-EX networking middleware, also developed at Berkeley Lab. On many combinations of applications and platforms, GASNet-EX outperforms the widely used Message Passing Interface (MPI). Through GASNet-EX's support for communicating between graphics processing units (GPU), GASNet-EX has features that specifically target the emerging, leading-edge exascale computing platforms.",
