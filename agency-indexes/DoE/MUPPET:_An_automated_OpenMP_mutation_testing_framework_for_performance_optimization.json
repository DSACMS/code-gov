    "description": "MUPPET is a tool for OpenMP programs that identifies program modifications, called mutations, aimed at\nimproving program performance. Existing performance optimization techniques, including profiling-based\nand auto-tuning techniques, fail to indicate program modifications at the source level thus preventing their\nportability across compilers. MUPPET aims to help HPC developers reason about performance defects\nand missed opportunities to improve performance at the source code level.",
