    "description": "This software improves upon the Clifford gate+T gate magic state strong simulation algorithm by Brayvi and Gosset. It provides a better stabilizer state decomposition that scales as 2^{0.463t}, an improvement over 2^{0.468t}, for t T gate magic states. This code enables simulations of universal quantum computing with that asymptotic scaling cost.
