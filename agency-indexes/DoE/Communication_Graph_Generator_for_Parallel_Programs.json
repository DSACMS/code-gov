    "description": "Graphator is a collection of relatively simple sequential programs that generate communication graphs/matrices for commonly occurring patterns in parallel programs. Currently, there is support for five communication patterns: two-dimensional 4-point stencil, four-dimensional 8-point stencil, all-to-alls over sub-communicators, random near-neighbor communication, and near-neighbor communication.",
