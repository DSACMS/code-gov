    "description": "The purpose of this code is to provide a high-fidelity model of Type-5 wind turbine drivetrain for grid integration and transient stability studies. The increasing integration of renewable energy resources in evolving bulk power system (BPS) is impacting the system\u2019s inertia. Type-5 wind turbine generation has the potential to behave like a traditional synchronous generator and can help mitigate the aforementioned impact. A hydraulic torque converter (TC) and gearbox with torque limiting feature are integral parts of a Type-5 wind turbine unit. A generic and high-fidelity model of a Type-5 wind turbine drivetrain is not openly and widely available for grid integration and transient stability studies. This hinders appropriate assessment of Type-5 wind power plant's contribution to the BPS resilience. This work develops and validates a TC model based on those generally used in automobile's transmission system.",
