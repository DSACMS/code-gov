    "description": "DESTINY is a comprehensive tool for modeling 3D and 2D cache designs using SRAM,embedded DRAM (eDRAM), spin transfer torque RAM (STT-RAM), resistive RAM (ReRAM), and phase change RAM (PCN). In its purpose, it is similar to CACTI, CACTI-3DD or NVSim. DESTINY is very useful for performing design-space exploration across several dimensions, such as optimizing for a target (e.g. latency, area or energy-delay product) for agiven memory technology, choosing the suitable memory technology or fabrication method (i.e. 2D v/s 3D) for a given optimization target, etc. DESTINY has been validated against several cache prototypes. DESTINY is expected to boost studies of next-generation memory architectures used in systems ranging from mobile devices to extreme-scale supercomputers.",
