    "description": "VeloC: Very Low Overhead Transparent Multilevel Checkpoint/Restart. The VeloC software suite will be a multilevel checkpoint/restart interface and implementation for exascale applications. VeloC will have three major impacts. It will: (1) optimize checkpoint/restart perfonnance for applications and workflows (2) increase programmer productivity by dramatically reducing the difficulty of handling varied and complex storage architectures and the need for\nperformance/reliability optimizations. (3) benefit a wide community.\nVeloC is a collaboration between LLNL and ANL as part of the Exascale Computing Project. ",
