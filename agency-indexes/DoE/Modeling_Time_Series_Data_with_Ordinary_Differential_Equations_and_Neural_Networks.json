    "description": "This suite of code learns neural network models to emulate the dynamics of time series data. \n\nTo do so, it learns a set of \"neural shape functions\" that provide a common vocabulary for expressing the various dynamics operators. \n\nThe code is implemented in Python and TensorFlow.",
