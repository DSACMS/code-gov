    "description": "This software provides the implementation and operation of a network based mixed-reality platform for Digital prototyping of scientific and materials discovery process. It provides human-in-the-loop approach for materials/process design, synthesis automation, and intelligent methods of feedback optimization. The software is accomplished through network-distributed integration based on robot operating system (ROS) of virtual-reality modeling and simulation, real-time 3D environmental sensing, tracking, and reconstruction, augmented-reality, process automation based on machine learning",
