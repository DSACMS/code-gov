    "description": "GASNet is a language-independent, networking middleware layer that provides network-independent, high-performance communication primitives including Remote Memory Access (RMA) and Active Messages (AM). It has been used to implement parallel programming models and libraries such as UPC, Co-Array Fortran, Titanium, Legion, Chapel, and many others. The interface is primarily intended as a compilation target and for use by runtime library writers (as opposed to end users), and the primary goals are high performance, interface portability, and expressiveness. GASNet stands for \"Global-Address Space Networking\". \n\n",
