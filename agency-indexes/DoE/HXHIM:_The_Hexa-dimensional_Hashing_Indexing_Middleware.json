    "description": "As HPC physics simulations grow ever larger in size, accessing the data generated by them becomes an increasingly difficult challenge. Searching for individual pieces of data or ranges of data in storage takes significant amounts of time that could be better spent elsewhere. In order to reduce the cost of pulling data from storage, we have developed the Hexadimensional Hashing Indexing Middleware (HXHIM). HXHIM is a distributed key-value store library written in C++ with a C api with networking performed by MPI and Thallium, and with LevelDB as the storage backend. Data is stored as Subject-Predicate-Object triples that can be searched for in any combination and can return ranges of data instead of just a single data point, allowing for fast, parallel extraction of large amounts of data from storage in significantly less time than existing methods are able to obtain the same data.",
