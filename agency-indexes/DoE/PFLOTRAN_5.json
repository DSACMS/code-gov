    "description": "PFLOTRAN leverages massively parallel, high performance computing to simulate large-scale non-isothermal multiphase\nflow, multicomponent reactive transport and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) problems in the subsurface\nenvironment. Researchers have employed PFLOTRAN to simulate these Earth system processes on leadership class\nsupercomputers for over two decades. The code is designed to predict the future estate of environmental systems and\nbetter inform stakeholders in the regulatory decision making process (e.g., fate of contaminants, long-term stewardship for\nnuclear waste, impact of climate change, etc.). A diverse team of scientists oversees PFLOTRAN development and\nmaintenance under an open-source licensing agreement and manages contributions from an international community of\nresearchers.",
