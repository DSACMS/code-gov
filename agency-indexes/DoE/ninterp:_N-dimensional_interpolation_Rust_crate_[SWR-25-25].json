    "description": "The ninterp crate provides multivariate interpolation over a regular, sorted, nonrepeating grid of any dimensionality. A variety of interpolation strategies are implemented, however more are likely to be added. Extrapolation beyond the range of the supplied coordinates is supported for 1-D linear interpolators, using the slope of the nearby points.\n\nThere are hard-coded interpolators for lower dimensionalities (up to N = 3) for better runtime performance.\n\nAll interpolation is handled through instances of the Interpolator enum, with the selected tuple variant containing relevant data. Interpolation is executed by calling Interpolator::interpolate.",
