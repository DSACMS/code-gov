    "description": "BuildStockQuery is a python library designed to simplify and streamline the process of querying massive, terabyte-scale datasets generated by ResStock(TM). ResStock (SWR-19-15) is a U.S. DOE-supported, NREL-built, national residential building energy stock model that enables a new approach to large-scale residential energy analysis across the U.S. by combining large public and private data sources, statistical sampling, detailed sub-hourly building simulations, and high-performance computing.  \n\nBuildStockQuery offers an intuitive Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) interface to the ResStock output dataset allowing users to easily perform common queries and receive results in familiar pandas DataFrame format, abstracting away the need for complex SQL query.  By initializing a query object with the pertinent Athena database and table names, users can easily query for various kinds of insights, for example, timeseries electricity for an end use for a given state grouped by building types.",
