    "description": "The software interpolates tabular data, such as for equations of state, provided on an unstructured triangular grid. In particular, interpolation occurs in a two dimensional space by looking up the triangle in which the desired evaluation point resides and then performing a linear interpolation over the n-tuples associated with the nodes of the chosen triangle. The interface to the interpolation routines allows for automated conversion of units from those tabulated to the desired output units. when multiple tables are included in a data file, new tables may be generated by on-the-fly mixing of the provided tables",
