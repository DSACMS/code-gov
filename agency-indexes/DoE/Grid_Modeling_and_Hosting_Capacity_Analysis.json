    "description": "An interface with the OpenDSS distribution grid simulator, facilitating users in\ncalibrating and validating models. Additionally, three distinct tools have been developed:\nPV Hosting Capacity: This tool allows users to determine the additional amount of photovoltaic (PV) generation that can be\nintegrated into the system without breaching operational constraints.\nEV Hosting Capacity: This tool focuses on identifying the capacity for incorporating extra electric vehicle (EV) load into the\nsystem without surpassing operational limitations.\nProject Impact Analysis Tool: This tool is designed to assess and report all potential grid violations associated with a\nspecific project, providing valuable insights into its impact on the distribution grid.",
