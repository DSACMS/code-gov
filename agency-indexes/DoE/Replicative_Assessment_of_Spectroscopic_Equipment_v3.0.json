    "description": "The Replicative Assessment of Spectrometric Equipment (RASE) is a software for evaluating the\nperformance of radiation detectors and isotope identification algorithms. It uses a semi-empirical\napproach to rapidly generate synthetic spectra and inject into detector's software to obtain nuclide\nidentification response. RASE facilitates studies of spectroscopic device performance and a quantitative\nassessment of its capabilities to correctly distinguish and identify isotopes of interest in realistic scenarios",
