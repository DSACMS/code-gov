    "description": "We have developed a deep learning based method to decode the protein-ligand interactions and predict their probability of binding. We use 3-Dimensional structure of proteins and ligand molecules with the ligand docked to the receptor and use the information at the interaction region to assess the binding of the protein-ligand complex.",
