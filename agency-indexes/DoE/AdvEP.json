    "description": "AdvEP is a code repository which contains PyTorch implementations of various adversarial attacks on a deep neural network trained with Equilibrium Propagation (EP), which is a neuromorphic learning framework. AdvEP allows for the training, testing, and conducting white/black-box attacks of EP models on a wide variety of applications and datasets. AdvEP is based on the open-source code https://github.com/Laborieux-Axel/Equilibrium-Propagation which was developed to train energy models. AdvEP was created by modifying the original code to perform and test against adversarial attacks. AdvEP was developed in Python, a high-level programming language that takes advantage of the Python ecosystem of high-quality open-source packages for machine learning. AdvEP interfaces heavily with the open-source PyTorch Python package as well as the open-source Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART) package.",
