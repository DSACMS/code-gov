    "description": "The work done on the open source MPI.jl package was done in order to allow it to work with a streaming, in-situ Gaussian process. The addition was to add the capability for the Julia package to use the MPI non-blocking Barrier, Ibarrier. This involved addition of a small chunk of code to the existing package basically replicating the function for the existing blocking MPI barrier but adapted handle the MPI Ibarrier interface.",
