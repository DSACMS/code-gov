    "description": "This software is used to process the raw data from the GridSweep instrument, a device developed under subcontract by McEachern Laboroatories for a DOE GMLC project. The software scrubbs, demodulates, and transforms point on wave voltage timeseries data into frequency/voltage amplitude/time data. It also has a GUI that allows for user selection of processed experimental data and graphing in heatmaps or 3-D plots. It was created alongside the GridSweep instrument as a part of the same project and is required to be open-source.",
