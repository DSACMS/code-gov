    "description": "This code can be used to generate a damage map based on the presence of rubble. Rubble is often detectable in images with submeter resolution, and can indicate damage to structures from high winds or earthquakes. The process_images.py script outputs a mask indicating the pixels in the original image where rubble was detected. The mask can be used in a geospatial software application like ArcMap to generate a damage map based on the rubble density. The rubble detection mask will contain some false positives which are usually more isolated than true rubble, so a density map will provide a more accurate indication of affected areas than the indivdidual rubble detections will.",
