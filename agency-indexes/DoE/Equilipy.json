    "description": "There is high demand for high-throughput calculations of phase equilibria based on the CALPHAD method (CALculation of PHAse Diagram). High-throughput calculations are possible through HPC, currently by a commercial program called Thermo-Calc. However, the number of nodes/processors are limited to the number of purchased license (16 processors per license). This program provides a toolkit for high-throughput calculations of phase equilibria by the CALPHAD method. The program is prepared for Python environment, so that it can be easily installed and used together with other open-source programs. The program can be run in supercomputer.",
