    "description": "Demeter-W, an open-access software written in Python, consists of extensible module packages. It is developed with statistical downscaling algorithms, to spatially and temporally downscale water demand data into finer scale. The spatial resolution will be downscaled from region/basin scale to grid (0.5 geographic degree) scale and the temporal resolution will be downscaled from year to month. For better understanding of the driving forces and patterns for global water withdrawal, the researchers is able to utilize Demeter-W to reconstruct the data sets to examine the issues related to water withdrawals at fine spatial and temporal scales.",
