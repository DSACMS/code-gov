    "description": "QuESt is an open source, Python-based application suite for energy storage simulation and analysis. The initial release will include an application for energy storage valuation, an analysis where the maximum revenue of a hypothetical energy storage device is estimated using historical energy market data. This is done by determining the sequence of state of charge management actions that optimize revenue generation, assuming perfect foresight of the historical data. The initial release will also include a utility to obtain historical data directly from supported market operating entities for use in analysis. More applications will be added as they are developed. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
