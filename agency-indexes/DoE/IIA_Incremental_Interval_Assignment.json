    "description": "IIA is a solver for optimizing integer matrix problems Ax=b. It was developed to decide the number of mesh edges on model curves (intervals) for quad and hex meshing. Meshing schemes impose constraints ranging from the mild requirement (i.e. that any quad mesh must have an even number of edges on its boundary) to structured mapped patches where opposite sides of a rectangle must have exactly equal numbers of edges. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.\nSAND2020-13618 M",
