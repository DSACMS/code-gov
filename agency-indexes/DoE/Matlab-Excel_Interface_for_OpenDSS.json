    "description": "The software allows users of the OpenDSS grid modeling software to access their load flow models using a GUI interface developed in MATLAB. The circuit definitions are entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet which makes circuit creation and editing a much simpler process than the basic text-based editors used in the native OpenDSS interface. Plot tools have been developed which can be accessed through a MATLAB GUI once the desired parameters have been simulated.",
