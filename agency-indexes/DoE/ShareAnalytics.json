    "description": "ShareAnalytics is a lightweight extensible platform for collaborative data analytics and facility characterization via Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM). It consists of three core components: a full stack web application, a dashboard tool for analyzing streaming data and a High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster leveraging slurm for resource management to perform real time analysis. The entire framework is implemented in Docker for ease of deployment and to allow the user to test the platform before making a significant investment in hardware if they require additional computing resources. While many other platforms for analyzing streaming data exists, ShareAnalytics is unique in that HPC capabilities and facility characterization via scored analytics are fully integrated into the platform.",
