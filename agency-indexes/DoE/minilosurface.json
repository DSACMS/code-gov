    "description": "The miniIsosurface package provides a collection of reference implementations for finding a representation for a contour of a scalar field in a volume. Contouring is a well-studied algorithm in scientific visualization and there are many algorithm variations to solve it. The miniIsosurface package provides a convenient collection of the most popular variations of the contour algorithm and some variations to run in different parallel environments.",
