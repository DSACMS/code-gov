    "description": "This software provides a basic Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) template for modeling 2D slices of N-body dark matter simulations, as part of the Exalearn project. The underlying design is a standard deep convolutional GAN, but we augment it with a technique we are calling multi-channel rescaling. This technique adds a second image channel to the output of the GAN, which represents the data in a different normalization in order to improve the quality of the results.",
