    "description": "Network Collapse is a STEM education VR game for grade 6-12 students to interactively learn about how information is transmitted and protected on networks. Players assume the role of a router and must transfer incoming data packets to the correct outgoing pathway without losing too many. Eventually the player must also recognize a cyber-attack and turn on the best tool to protect their network. Six levels introduce core basic ideas with increasing complexity in game play to maintain engagement while learning new ideas. The game is designed to run on the standalone VR headset, Oculus Go.",
