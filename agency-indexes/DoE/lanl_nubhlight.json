    "description": "nubhlight is a code for simulating disks of materials around black holes formed after the in-spiral and merger of two-black holes. It is based on the open-source code bhlight. nubhlight models all relevant physics required to solve the post-merger disk problem. This includes: general relativity in a static spacetime, neutrino and weak physics, relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, and the ability to use open-sourced tabulated equations of state provided by stellarcollapse.org.\n",
