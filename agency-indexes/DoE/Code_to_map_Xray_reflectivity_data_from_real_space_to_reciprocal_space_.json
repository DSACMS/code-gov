    "description": "Code to map X-ray reflectivity data from real space to reciprocal space. \n The code is written as a Jupyter notebook. Example data are included as a separate file (example_data.csv). These data were collected on a Panalytical XRD system. As a first step, run all cells in the notebook. Opportunities are identified for users to make their own choices for choosing the boundaries of the region of interest to estimate background. A simple algorithm is used to estimate background from the outer regions of the data collection region, interpolating the result inside the region of interest.  The background is removed and then the data mapped to Qx-Qz (reciprocal space) coordinates. The results are written as NumPy binary and Matlab formatted files.",
