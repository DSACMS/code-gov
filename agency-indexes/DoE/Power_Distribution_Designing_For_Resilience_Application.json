    "description": "The number of power outages have been on the rise as extreme weather patterns have been occurring more frequently due to climate change. These outages have an economic impact in the billions of dollar. The modernization of the power grid and adoption of high penetration of distributed generation such as wind and solar have the potential to reduce the number and length of time of these power outages. However, planners and operators need a way to value the resilience the distributed assets provide to the grid. PowDDeR is a tool that allows them to evaluate the resilience each asset provides as well as how they provide resilience over the connected network.",
