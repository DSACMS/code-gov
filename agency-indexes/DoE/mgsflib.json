    "description": "Code for my PhD thesis that creates meshes using gmsh and code I wrote to create high-order hybrid meshes to use for testing a hybrid method between spectral element method and generalized finite differences. It also uses a tetrahedral mesh improvement method called \"stellar\" to improve mesh quality near a curved boundary.",
