    "description": "DARMA/detector => Minimal C++ detection idiom. detector is a small library that implements static/compile-time type introspection in C++. With this code, we can check if a type has methods, type aliases, or members that are exactly matching or convertible to a particular interface. Because this library requires C++-14, it is separated from the other DARMA/* libraries.",
