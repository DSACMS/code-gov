    "description": "EzGet facilitates retrieval of data stored in popular formats (including DRS, netCDF, GrADS, and if a control file is supplied, GRIB).  EzGET (pronounced\neasy-get) is specifically designed to access climate data and climate model output.  You can specify how the data should be structured and whether it should  undergo a grid transformation before you receive it, even when you know little about the structure of the stored data (i.e., its dimension order, grid, and domain).",
