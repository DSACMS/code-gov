    "description": "Amesh generates discretized grids for numerical modeling of flow and transport problems in which the formulation is based on the integral finite difference method (IFDM). For example, the output of Amesh can be used directly as input to the TOUGH2 or TOUGH3 numerical simulators. Amesh can generate 1D, 2D, or 3D numerical grids for a given set of locations, i.e., the centers of each discrete sub-domain. In the 2D areal plane Voronoi tessellation is used.",
