    "description": "The Gendersllnl package is a local genders package that contains libraries with extra helper functions for Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) specific needs. They illustrate how local APIs can be developed on top of the genders base API. The LLNL tool dist2 is also included in the Gendersllnl package. A number of the libraries and tools in this package may be useful for clusters outside of Lawrence Livermore, but they may need to be modified for use on your particular systems. They are perhaps best used as an illustration of how libraries and tools can be built on top of the base genders libraries and tools.\n",
