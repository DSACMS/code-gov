    "description": "TAP is a set of tools which are essential for conducting research on adaptive partitioners. The basic premise is that a single partitioner may not be a good choice for adaptive mesh simulations; rather one must match a partitioner (obtained from a partitioning package like Zoltan, ParMetis etc) with the mesh being partitioned. TAP provides the tools that can judge the suitability of a partitioning algorithm to a given mesh.",
