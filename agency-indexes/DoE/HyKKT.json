    "description": "HyKKT (pronounced as \"hiked\") is a package for solving systems of linear equations of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) form, which typically arise in optimization problems, such as optimal power flow analysis. HyKKT uses Cholesky instead of LDL^T factorization and solves the general KKT system to a desired numerical precision via block reduction and conjugate gradient on the Schur complement. Such implementation is more suitable for implementation on graphic processing units (GPUs).",
