    "description": "Coramin is a package that provides tools for developing tailored algorithms for mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems. This software includes the ability to:\n- Generate convex or piecewise relaxations of nonlinear optimization problems, addressing bilinear, quadratic, and convex/concave univariate functions\n- Perform optimization-based bounds tightening on all or subsets of the problem variables\n- Generate polyhedral envelopes for multi-linear functions",
