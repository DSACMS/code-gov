    "description": "MiGRIDS is a software that models islanded microgrid power systems with different controls and components. For example, using load and resource data from a microgrid, you could model it with additional wind turbines, battery etc. You could also try out different dispatch schemes to see which one worked best.\n\nMiGRIDS is designed to help optimize the size and dispatch of grid components in a microgrid. While a grid connect feature is expected to be added in the future, islanded operation is the focus. Note that this is a basic implementation and more features and functionality (such as a GUI) are coming!\n\nMiGRIDS runs time-step energy balance simulations for different grid components and controls. In smaller microgrid environments, dispatch decisions are being made on the order of seconds. In order to fully capture their effect, this tool lets you run simulations on the order of seconds. The end result is a more realistic representation of what can be achieved by integrating different components and control strategies in a grid.",
