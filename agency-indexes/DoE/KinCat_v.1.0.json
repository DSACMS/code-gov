    "description": "SAND2024-02099O\nThe software is designed to allow researchers to perform kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations of catalytic reactions on a 2D lattice. The code is written efficiently to run on a variety of shared memory computing architectures (e.g. GPU, multi-core) and to natively express the full complexity of lateral interactions on reaction rates. The software allows researchers to perform KMC simulations of catalytic reactions on a 2D lattice. It uses parallel shared-memory computing architectures to reduce run-times and allows for simultaneous simulation of multiple independent runs.  Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
