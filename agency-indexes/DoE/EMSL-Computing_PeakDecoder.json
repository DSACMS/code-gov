    "description": "PeakDecoder is a machine learning (ML)-based metabolite identification algorithm for multidimensional mass spectrometry measurements incorporating liquid chromatography (LC) and ion mobility spectrometry (IM) separations, and collecting extensive fragmentation spectra with data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods: LC-IM-DIA-MS. The algorithm learns to distinguish true co-elution and co-mobility from raw data and calculates metabolite identification error rates.",
