    "description": "EDIPIC codes were developed for simulation of kinetic effects in low-temperature plasmas. They can be used for simulation of plasmas in electrostatic approximation and include many atomistic and plasma-surface interaction processes needed for simulations of low temperature plasmas. These codes include a detailed model of secondary electron emission induced by electrons and ions. The Monte-Carlo model of electron-neutral collisions and the Langevin model of Coulomb collisions for electrons are also implemented.",
