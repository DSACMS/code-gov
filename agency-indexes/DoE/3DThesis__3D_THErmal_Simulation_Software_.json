    "description": "There is a need for a way to simulate the heat transfer conditions for the entire layer of a build (both temperature and solidification gradient and velocity). CFD models could do this but those may take months to finish a simulation. The solution is an adaptive integration scheme for a analytic, conduction-only approach for a volumetric Gaussian heat source. Because this is analytic, it also allows increased functionality as well. 3DThesis can simulate heat transfer conditions for a volumetric Gaussian heat source moving in an arbitrary path at a point in time. This allows for the calculation of discrete snapshots of the temperature field or even the final solidification gradients and velocities.",
