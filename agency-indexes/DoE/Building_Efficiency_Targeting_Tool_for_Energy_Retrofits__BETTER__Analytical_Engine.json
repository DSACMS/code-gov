    "description": "This is an open-source, empirical data-driven, virtual building energy analysis and retrofit targeting tool. The open-source tool will provide a fully-automated, \"no-cost/no-touch\" approach to screen large volumes of buildings for operational improvement and equipment upgrade opportunities and quantify associated potential energy and cost savings.",
