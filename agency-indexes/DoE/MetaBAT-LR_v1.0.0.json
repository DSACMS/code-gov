    "description": "MetaBAT-LR is an extension to the metaBAT program, which adds functionalities to leverage various datasets (long-reads, Hi-C) to improve the completeness of metagenome binning while keeping contamination levels low. It trains a random forest model using the self-supervised training paradigm to predict linkage information among metagenome scaffolds, then uses this information to recruit unbinned scaffolds and merge incomplete bins that are from the same species.",
