    "description": "The Sequence Read Archive (SRA) is a cloud-based repository of biological sequence data provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The SRA is a database of \u201craw\u201d sequencing data \u2013 typically short (100 bp \u2013 1000 bp) nucleotide sequences generated by modern, next-generation sequencing instruments and submitted by researchers around the world. Data in the SRA is stored in a highly-compressed binary format that can be directly read by most bioinformatics analysis tools. Existing tools to convert this binary data into standard nucleic acid sequence formats (like FASTA and FASTQ) are slow and error prone (due to a computationally demanding reordering step to place the sequenced reads in their originally submitted order). The \u201csracat\u201d tool provides a fast, reliable conversion utility for use-cases that do not require ordered reads.",
