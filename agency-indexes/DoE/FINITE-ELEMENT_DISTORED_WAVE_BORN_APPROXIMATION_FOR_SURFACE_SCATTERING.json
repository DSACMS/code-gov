    "description": "FE-DWBA is a software package that computes the x-ray scattering patterns of objects that locate on \na surface or buried next to a surface, such as the nano-circuits and nano-patterns of the mask used \nin the extreme ultraviolet lithography. It can incorporate the dynamical scattering effect (photons \nscattered multiple times), which is predominant in surface scattering and yield high-fidelity \nscattering patterns. The application includes surface imaging using x-rays, and critical dimension \ndetermination for semiconductor manufacturing.\n\n",
