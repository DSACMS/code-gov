    "description": "MemSurfer is a software tool to compute bilayer membrane surfaces. These surfaces are found in the biophysical simulations, and generally analyzed using a set of python packages. MemSurfer offers new robust functionalities to compute the undulations in the surfaces, and relevant properties of the lipids *along* the surface, rather than along the projections, as done in many existing tools.",
