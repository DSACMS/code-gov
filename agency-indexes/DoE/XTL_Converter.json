    "description": "\"XTL Converter\" is a short Python script for electron microscopy simulation. The program takes an input crystal file in the VESTA *.XTL format and converts it to a text format readable by the multislice simulation program \u00ecSTEM. The process of converting a crystal *.XTL file to the format used by the \u00ecSTEM simulation program is quite tedious&#894; it generally requires the user to select dozens or hundreds of atoms, rearranging and reformatting their position. Header information must also be reformatted to a specific style to be read by \u00ecSTEM. \"XTL Converter\" simplifies this process, saving the user time and allowing for easy batch processing of crystals.",
