    "description": "SAND2024-08551O\nThe Spatial Environmental Assessment Tool (SEAT) evaluates potential environmental risk associated with marine energy device deployment by coupling modeled impacts with risk severity maps. As a graphical user interface-based software, it interacts with marine energy stressor and receptor data to evaluate the risk of changes to marine environment. SEAT, which relies on spatial and temporal data, is a plug-in for geospatial software QGIS.  Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
