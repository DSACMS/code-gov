    "description": "In order to support the California state goals to reduce the carbon and pollution emissions (AB2127), The goal of this project (HEVI-Pro) is to project the charging infrastructure needs by future medium- and heavy- duty electric vehicles, and assess optimal deployment the infrastructure in California and provide grid impacts analysis. The MHDV projections will also consider transportation system and electric system interaction with light duty vehicles. The project consists of 2 approaches in general: top-down approach that takes aggregated MHDV adoptions as the inputs and provide the county-level projections of charging load profile and infrastructure need, and the bottom-up approach that that incorporates more granular (temporal, spatial and duty-cycle-specific) behaviors of a variety of MHDVs into activity simulations/optimizations for further analysis.",
