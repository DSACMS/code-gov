    "description": "This software comprises a portable, open-source implementation of a runtime library to support applications written in the Unified Parallel C (UPC) language. This library implements the UPC-specific functionality, including shared-memory allocation and distributed locks. The network-dependent functionality is implemented as a thin wrapper around the separate GASNet (Global-Address Space Networking) library, which is required for operation. This software implements the \"Berkeley UPC Runtime Specification\", which is targeted by at least four separate UPC compiler front-ends. The implementation is highly portable and runs over hardware ranging from laptops to custom supercomputers. An external library is required for certain local memory allocation operations; a well-defined interface allows for multiple implementations of this library, but at present the \"umalloc\" library from LBNL is the only compatible implementation.",
