    "description": "This package provides a secure transport layer connecting mini-applications run as components of a server infrastructure.  The guiding principle is that mini-apps should be \"actors\" -- able to expose a set of API calls to the network and to have a shared trust model for knowing who is calling which API function and who takes\nresponsibility for the result.",
