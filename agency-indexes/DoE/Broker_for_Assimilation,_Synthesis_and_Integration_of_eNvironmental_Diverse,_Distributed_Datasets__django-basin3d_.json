    "description": "BASIN-3D (Broker for Assimilation, Synthesis and Integration of eNvironmental Diverse, Distributed Datasets) uses a data brokering approach to synthesize diverse earth science data from a variety of remote sources in real-time without the need for additional storage. BASIN-3D is an extendable Django web framework application using a generalized data synthesis model that makes the synthesized data available via Application Programming Interface (API). This extends the basin3d Python framework for data synthesis (http://github.com/BASIN-3D/basin3d).We have currently implemented our data synthesis model to represent sensor-based time series earth science observations across a hierarchy of spatial locations. Supporting our data synthesis model is a plugin framework that allows developers to map data sources of interest to the BASIN-3D synthesis model.",
