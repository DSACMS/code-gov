    "description": "This software automates the production of standalone emulators for complex computer models. The end result of running the software is a piece of code called an emulator, a statistical approximation which predicts the output of complex computer simulation, but at a much faster speed. The emulator is built using a training set of inputs and outputs from the simulations. The input-output pairs are used in a Bayesian scheme to estimate the parameters of a Gaussian process based regression model that learns the input-output relationship. The estimated parameters are combined with a generic C skeleton to produce a compile-able instantiation of the emulator.",
