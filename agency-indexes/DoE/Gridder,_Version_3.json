    "description": "GRIDDER is a simple interactive grid generation tool for creating orthogonal, 2D quadrilateral or 3D hexahedral grids. Grid spacing can be even, logarithmic, or geometric. Gridder creates orthogonal one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three- dimensional grids. Each dimension can have multiple regions, each with different nodal spacing. This spacing can be equal spacing, geometric spacing, or logarithmic spacing. The resulting grid can be output in AVS (Advanced Visualization Systems) format, Tracer 30, Vectors, or FEHM format. Coordinate and connectivity data are output for AVS, but only coordinate data is output for Tracer30. As it runs, Gridder prompts the user for input such as number of dimensions, number of regions in each dimension, coordinates of region borders, number of divisions in each region, spacing specifications of each region, and output format. The Gridder can also accept the necessary information from a file, bypassing the interactive interface. Every time the interactive interface is used, the input parameters are saved to a file so that the same grid can be regenerated from that file.",
