    "description": "OpenCGRA is an open-source framework for modeling, testing, and evaluating CGRAs. The first open-source integrated framework able to support the full top-to-bottom design flow for specializing and implementing CGRAs: modeling at different abstraction levels (functional level, cycle level, register-transfer level) with compiler support, verification at different granularities (unit testing, integration testing, property-based testing), simulation, generation of synthesizable Verilog, and characterization (area, power, and timing).",
