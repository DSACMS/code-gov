    "description": "Transparent Asynchronous Zero-copy Remote I/O (TAZeR) is a framework built to facilitate grid computing by easing the memory movement and management across geographically separated computing resources. TAZeR employs a multiclient/\nmulti-server paradigm where data is stored at on a remote server. Users preload an interposing library which upon application start-up, stands up an ephemeral lightweight client. The client captures POSIX I/O calls to TAZeR meta-files which contains the IP address/port of the remote server, the location of the file on remote server, and additional meta-data.\nThe client connects to the server using this information and begins downloading the file in parts optionally compressing the data.",
