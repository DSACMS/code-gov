    "description": "\tBecquerel is a Python package for analyzing nuclear spectroscopic measurements. The core functionalities are reading and writing different spectrum file types, fitting spectral features, performing detector calibrations, and interpreting measurement results. It will include tools for plotting radiation spectra and fits of different spectral features, as well as convenient access to tabulated nuclear data. It relies heavily on the standard scientific Python stack of numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and pandas. It is intended to be general-purpose enough that it can be useful to anyone from an undergraduate taking a laboratory course to the advanced researcher.",
