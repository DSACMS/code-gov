    "description": "The Java Software Extensibility Library provides tools that help Java software developers produce flexible and extensible Java applications. The major components include a Plugin Library and a Polymorphic Map data structure. The Plugin Library provides developers with a Plugin Registry and a standard pattern for designing, versioning, registering, retrieving, and annotating plugins. It also enables advanced capabilities such as loading plugins at runtime, and creating/loading encrypted plugin packages. The Polymorphic Map data structure facilitates the storage and retrieval of objects of varying types within a single data structure; while maintaining type safety. The library also provides a standard design pattern for producing application-specific \"Domain Maps\" and \"Closed Domain Maps\".SAND2020-3816 M\n\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
