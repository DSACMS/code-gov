    "description": "SAND2022-3387 O FallBack MPI (FBMPI) is a fallback implementation of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) which is used in high performance computing software. FBMPI ensures that MPI is always present so that high performance computing software does not need to spend funding on the use case where MPI is not present. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
