    "description": "Codes developed by ASC supported personnel for generating semi-analytic solutions to traditional verification test problems. \n\nConcrete example is a script written to do a numerical integral of an analytic function that serves as a known solution to a complex differential equation.  This is very useful when checking if your general purpose physics code can produce the solution you expect when it starts from a set of known initial conditions.  If the form of the integral is complex, the only way to evaluate the integral is to write a code that performs the integration numerically.",
