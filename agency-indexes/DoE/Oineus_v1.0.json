    "description": "A library for multi-threaded computation of persistence diagrams. The algorithm for computing persistence diagrams in a lock-free manner was published in the 'Towards Lock-free Persistent Homology' (D. Morozov, A. Nigmetov, Brief Announcement: SPAA 2020); it scales better than the only other shared-memory parallel implementation of persistent homology computation PHAT. Library includes python bindings to compute persistence diagrams and their vectorizations for lower-star filtrations on grid data. It is intended to be used by scientists working on Topological Data Analysis and its applications in different areas.",
