    "description": "This software package includes hydro governor and turbine models developed in Simulink (Mathworks Inc.) and RSCAD (RTDS Technologies) for low-head bulb-style Kaplan turbine hydropower plants. The model developed in Simulink has been designed and tuned to match the governor-turbine response for a real-world hydropower unit owned by Idaho Falls Power (IFP). The Simulink and RSCAD models enable real-time testing in a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) implementation using OPAL-RT and RTDS digital real-time simulators, respectively. An automatic initialization for dynamic simulation has also been integrated to each model in both Simulink and RSCAD. The RSCAD initialization involves a novel python-based interfacing for automatic modification of the initial conditions in the model. The parameters of these models can be tuned to match other hydropower plants in this class.",
