    "description": "NALMS is an alarm system application designed for availability, integrability, and extensibility. The NALMS development was driven by SLAC's efforts to replace the Alarm Handler, due for deprecation as a Motif-based application, and to introduce process improvements addressing hierarchy implementation overhead, limited operator engagement, and operator display integration.",
