    "description": "LOKI is a simulation code that models weakly-coupled plasma evolution using Eulerian kinetic models in four phase space dimensions. The code is useful to understand basic plasma nonlinear plasma physics phenomena - in particular, wave-particle and wave-wave resonances that occur in laser plasma interactions. LOKI can simulate fundamental physical process in low-density plasmas on a scale of hundreds of light wavelengths. It does so by solving the relativistic Vlasov and Valsov-Fokker-Planck differential transport equations describing the collision less and low-collisionality evolution of charged particles in electromagnetic fields in two configuration space and two velocity space dimensions. Two principle electromagnetic models are provided: electrostatic (Poisson's Equation) and electromagnetic (Maxwell's equations).",
