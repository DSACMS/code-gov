    "description": "SHEBO (surrogate optimization of problems with hidden constraints and expensive black-box objectives) is an efficient optimization algorithm that employs surrogate models to solve computationally expensive black-box simulation optimization problems that have hidden constraints. Hidden constraints are encountered when the objective function evaluation does not return a value for a parameter vector. These constraints are often encountered in optimization problems in which the objective function is computed by a black-box simulation code. SHEBO uses a combination of local and global search strategies together with an evaluability prediction function and a dynamically adjusted evaluability threshold to iteratively select new sample points.",
