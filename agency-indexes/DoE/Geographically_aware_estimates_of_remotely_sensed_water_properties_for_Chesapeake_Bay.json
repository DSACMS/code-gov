    "description": "This software contains the code for a data-driven model to produce high-resolution (&lt; 1 km2) estimates of temperature, salinity, and turbidity over decadal time scales as required by next-generation Earth Systems Models. Our model fits daily MODIS Aqua reflectance data to surface observations (&lt; 1 m depth) from 2000-2021 in Chesapeake Bay, USA.",
