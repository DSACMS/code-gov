    "description": "This package contains R&D python codes that can nowcast >2 MeV electron distributions in the Earth's outer radiation belt, using LANL's GPS electron data (publicly available) as the primary driver. Functions of this PreMevE-MEO model has been described with details in a manuscript titled \"PreMevE-MEO: Predicting Ultra-relativistic Electrons Using Observations from GPS Satellites\" (LA-UR-24-23843), which has been submitted to Space Weather Journal.",
