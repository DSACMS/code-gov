    "description": "This open-source tool aims to provide a powerful and flexible platform for simulating electromagnetic transients (EMT) of large-scale inverter-based resource (IBR)-dominated power systems. The purpose of making it open source is to foster a community of EMT simulation and assist in exploring new EMT algorithms and applying advanced computational techniques to EMT simulation.",
