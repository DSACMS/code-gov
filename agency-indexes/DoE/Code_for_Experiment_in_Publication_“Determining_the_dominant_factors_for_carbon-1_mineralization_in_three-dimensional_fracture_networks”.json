    "description": "We plan to release the code used to perform the experiment described in our recent publication, entitled \u201cDetermining the dominant factors for carbon-1 mineralization in three-dimensional fracture networks.\u201d  This code fits a joint emulator to data from several Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) simulations, performed using the open-source software DFNworks (https://dfnworks.lanl.gov/).  All code to be released implements existing methods; there are no novel algorithms nor any major innovations to existing software.",
