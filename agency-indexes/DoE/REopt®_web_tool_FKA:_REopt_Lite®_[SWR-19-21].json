    "description": "The REopt\u00ae web tool (formerly known as REopt Lite\u00ae) evaluates the economic viability of grid-connected solar photovoltaics (PV), wind and battery storage at a commercial site. It allows building owners to identify the system sizes and dispatch strategy that minimize the site's life cycle cost of energy. REopt Lite\u00ae also estimates the amount of time a PV and/or wind and battery system can sustain the site's critical load during a grid outage and allows the user the choice of optimizing for energy resilience. The REopt\u00ae web tool may be found here: https://reopt.nrel.gov/tool/.",
