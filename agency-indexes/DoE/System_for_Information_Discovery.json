    "description": "SID characterizes natural language based documents so that they may be related and retrieved based on content similarity. This technology processes textual documents, autonomously identifies the major topics of the document set, and constructs an interpretable, high dimensional representation of each document. SID also provides the ability to interactively re-weight representations based on user needs, so that users may analyze the data set from multiple points of view. The particular advantages SID offers are speed, data compression, flexibility in representation, and incremental processing.",
