    "description": "Avalaunch implements a tree-based process launcher. It first bootstraps itself on to a set of compute nodes by launching children processes, which immediately connect back to the parent process to acquire info needed t launch their own children. Once the tree is established, user processes are started by broadcasting commands and application binaries through the tree. All communication flows over high-performance network protocols via spawnnet. The goal is to start MPI jobs having hundreds of thousands of processes within seconds.",
