    "description": "We provide a self-contained package to load, process, and test the ICF JAG dataset. In particular, we include a Neural Network designed to act as a surrogate for the JAG 1D Simulator. The neural network is implemented in Tensorflow.\nWe include a Jupyter notebook which allows a user to load the dataset, load the neural network and train it such that given just the 5 input parameters, it predicts the scalars and images accurately. This can be done directly in the notebook, without any additional modifications. During training, intermediate predictions are also saved to disk (as specified by the user). We hope this serves as a starting point to build, test and play with the ICF-JAG simulation dataset.",
