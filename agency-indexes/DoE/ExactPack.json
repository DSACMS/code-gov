    "description": "A new version of the verification tool ExactPack, 1.7.0, includes three new solvers: A Radshocks solver, Riemann solver and an Elastic-Plastic Piston problem solver. The code has been refactored to work with Python 3. All Fortran code has been removed and solvers implemented in Fortran have been re-implemented in Python where necessary. All unit tests have been converted to use the Pytest format and all the GUI, CLI and verification analysis code has been removed.",
