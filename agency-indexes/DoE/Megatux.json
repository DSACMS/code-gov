    "description": "The Megatux platform enables the emulation of large scale (multi-million node) distributed systems. In particular, it allows for the emulation of large-scale networks interconnecting a very large number of emulated computer systems. It does this by leveraging virtualization and associated technologies to allow hundreds of virtual computers to be hosted on a single moderately sized server or workstation. Virtualization technology provided by modern processors allows for multiple guest OSs to run at the same time, sharing the hardware resources. The Megatux platform can be deployed on a single PC, a small cluster of a few boxes or a large cluster of computers. With a modest cluster, the Megatux platform can emulate complex organizational networks. By using virtualization, we emulate the hardware, but run actual software enabling large scale without sacrificing fidelity.",
