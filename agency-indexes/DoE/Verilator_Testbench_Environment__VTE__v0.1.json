    "description": "VTE is a library that allows fast and simple generation of C++ testers for modules written in Chisel and build an efficient interface to existing C++ based simulators. It contains Scala-based interface and C++ testbench class. Scala interface interacts with Firtl Interpreter and generates a basic set of C++ testbench files. These files contain the list of the Device Under Test (DUT) input-output ports as well as their parameters. C++ testbench provides functionalities similar to the Chisel PeekPokeTester, such as poke, expect, step functions. As a backend it uses Verilator.\n",
