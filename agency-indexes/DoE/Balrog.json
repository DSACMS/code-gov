    "description": "SAND2022-12602 O\nBalrog uses mathematical methods to calculate spectral line shapes in high-energy-density plasmas. Line shapes are a result of atomic perturbations by their surrounding plasmas, and this model captures much of the physics and generates model spectrum that can be used in data analysis and as an input for other models.
