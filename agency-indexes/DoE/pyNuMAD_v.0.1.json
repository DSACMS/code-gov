    "description": "SAND2024-08606O\nThe pyNuMAD software is used for managing wind turbine blade model data. pyNuMAD specializes in defining the geometry, materials, and boundary conditions for structural analysis of wind turbine blades. This includes loading in data files and providing an interface for users to make updates to the model. The software also features meshing functionality, which takes the blade model and creates a shell or brick mesh for use in finite element analysis. A typical user workflow might be: load in blade information from a yaml file, make adjustments to the blade properties, update the blade based on the adjustments, create a mesh of the blade, export this blade to another software for structural analysis.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
