    "description": "The District EnErgy Planner - DEEP is an Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization software tool to solve district energy system, technology configuration, operation strategies, and energy retail business schemes. DEEP takes user input energy demand on heating, cooling and electricity demand. Energy loss through pipeline is calculated for heating and cooling from central plants. The optimal system configuration to minimize the district energy system life cycle cost or minimize CO2 emission is calculated based on energy balance equations and various constraints. The recent update on DEEP include a feature of waste heat utilization energy balance based optimization to take into accounts of different temperature bands of heat into account to maximize system efficiency. Another feature is to optimize district energy retail by provide optimal pricing scheme for heating, cooling and electricity to end users to incorporate district to grid demand response.",
