    "description": "Global Pathway Selection (GPS) is an algorithm to effectively generates reduced (skeletal) chemistry\nmechanisms, which speeds up simulations and can be used as a systematic analytics tool to extract\ninsights from complex reacting system. This release is an extension of the original code to run in parallel\nand to use LLNL's Zero-RK solver for fast solution of chemical problems.",
