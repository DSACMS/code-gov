    "description": "PyARC is a wrapper script developed to integrate the Argonne Reactor Computation suite of neutronic codes into the NEAMS Workbench user interface. It contains the Workbench \"common input\" definition, handles some pre-processing, writes the native codes inputs, handles the runtime environment, and performs some post-processing. It was developed to facilitate access and utilization of the ARC codes, and facilitate transition to higher fidelity NEAMS codes.",
