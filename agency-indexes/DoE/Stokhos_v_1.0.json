    "description": "A Trilinos package for applying stochastic Galerkin uncertainty quantification methods to large-scale C++ application codes, primarily stochastic partial differential equations. Stokhos is intended for use in estimating uncertainties for general scientific computations and is based on published algorithms. It provides no capability for implementing those computations itself. Estimating uncertainties and errors from solution algorithms or simulations, primarily simulations of partial differential equations, arising from uncertainties or errors in solution algorithm or simulation input data, including statistical moments, probabilities, and coefficients of variation.",
