    "description": "The Replicative Assessment of Spectroscopic Equipment (RASE) methodology is a semi-empirical approach to generating synthetic gamma-ray spectra for injection into a radionuclide identification algorithm of a vendor-provided detection system. RASE facilitates studies of the spectroscopic device performance and a quantitative assessment of its capabilities to correctly distinguish and identify isotopes of interest in realistic scenarios.",
