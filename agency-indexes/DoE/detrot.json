    "description": "This module performs abstractions for the CXI detector stands in order to manipulate them as rigid bodies. By first manipulating pairs of motors as joints, and then the stand as a collection of three unieque joints, higher level functions such as translate and rotate are created to help the operator quickly adjust the stand.\n",
