    "description": "SAND2024-08549O\nPyTorch Circuit-Aware Bit-Cell Modeling, a Python library, demonstrates circuit-aware training for analog machine learning accelerators. Built upon PyTorch, this software provides hardware-aware versions of common neural network layers to mitigate non-ideal behavior from novel hardware. The software provides accurate forward and backward pass estimates for hardware-mapped neural networks that are implemented in crossbars (arrays) that contain a non-linear transistor selector device. \nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
