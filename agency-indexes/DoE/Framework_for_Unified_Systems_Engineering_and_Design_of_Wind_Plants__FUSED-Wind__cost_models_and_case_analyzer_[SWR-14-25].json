    "description": "Framework for Unified Systems Engineering and Design of Wind Plants ( FUSED-Wind) is an open-source framework for multi-disciplinary optimisation and analysis (MDAO) of wind energy systems, developed jointly by DTU and NREL. The framework is designed as an extension to the NASA developed OpenMDAO, and defines key I/O elements and methods necessary for wiring together different simulation codes in order to achieve a system level analysis capability of wind turbine plants with multiple levels of fidelity. NREL and DTU have developed independent interfaces to their respective simulation codes and cost models (e.g. FAST/CCBlade, HAWC2/BECAS) with the aim of offering an environment where these codes can be used interchangeably. The open source nature of the framework enables third parties to develop interfaces to their own tools, either replacing or extending those offered by DTU and NREL.",
