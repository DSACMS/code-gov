    "description": "The code \u201cminiWeather\u201d solves the 2-D Euler equations with a Finite-Volume method on a regular Cartesian grid with Runge-Kutta time stepping, 4th-order hypervisocisty, and 4th-order spatial accuracy.  The code is primarily a parallel programming training mini application in Fortran, C, and C++ with MPI, OpenMP, OpenMP offload, OpenACC, and C++ portability approaches. It can also serve as a mini application for acceptance testing for new machines and compilers for both functionality and performance.",
