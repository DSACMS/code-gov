    "description": "\u201cThe code \u201cCertificate Validation Libraries\u201d provides the ability to validate x509 certificates in python using a simple library. These libraries validate certificates in 3 ways: 1) validation that certificate has not expired. 2) validation that certificate has not been revoked and 3) validation of certificate's digital signature. The benefits of this code is that one can properly validate x509 certificates, thus strengthening the security of systems using these libraries.\u201d",
