    "description": "Seismic interpretation aims to extract quantitative and interpretable attributes from a seismic image produced using some migration method to inform characteristics of a subsurface reservoir or target of interest. Current paradigms for computing seismic attributes mostly rely on single-task algorithms. We develop an iterative, multi-task machine learning method to learn and infer multiple attributes from a seismic image. This method is composed of two stages: a multi-task inference stage and a multi-modal, multi-task refinement stage. The basic mechanism of this method is that we train a multi-task inference neural network (NN) to estimate a set of attributes, including a relative geological time (RGT), a denoised higher-resolution (DHR) seismic image, and multiple fault attributes (including probability, dip, and strike), from a low-resolution, noisy seismic image; then we input the inferred attributes to a multi-task refinement NN to enhance the raw inference results iteratively. The two multi-task NNs are trained separately based on synthetic seismic images and associated attributes generated by a geological modeling algorithm.  The software we intend to release is a PyTorch implementation of this multi-task learning method for both 2D and 3D cases along with scripts to run the training/validation. The algorithm and software can be a useful tool for automatic seismic interpretation.",
