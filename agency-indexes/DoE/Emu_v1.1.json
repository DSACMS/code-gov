    "description": "Emu is a particle-in-cell code for solving the neutrino quantum kinetic equations in 1, 2, or 3 spatial dimensions with arbitrary angular resolution in order to simulate neutrino flavor transformation in neutron star merger and core collapse supernova environments. Emu represents the neutrino distribution function as a set of particles, each of which represent a collection of neutrinos and antineutrinos with unique position and momentum. Each particle carries two density matrices to define the flavor state of the neutrinos and antineutrinos it represents. Emu includes the vacuum, matter, and neutrino self-interaction potentials. Emu calculates the self-interaction potential using PIC deposition and interpolation algorithms that efficiently compute the local number density and flux at particle locations. Emu is implemented in C++ and is based on the AMReX library for high-performance, block-structured adaptive mesh refinement. Emu is parallelized with MPI + OpenMP for CPUs and MPI + CUDA for GPUs.",
