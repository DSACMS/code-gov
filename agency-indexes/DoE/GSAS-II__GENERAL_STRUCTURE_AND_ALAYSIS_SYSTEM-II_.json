    "description": "GSAS-II is a comprehensive data analysis and simulation software package for determining atomistic structures from single-crystal and powder diffraction data. X-ray, neutron and electron data may be used. Constant-wavelength, time-of-flight and pink-beam sources may be employed and analyses may combine different types of data. The package is oriented towards materials characterization problems, but protein crystallography, pair-distribution function analysis, small-angle scattering and reflectometry analysis are all included. GSAS-II provides tools for indexing and solving structures from powder diffraction data, in addition to structure, data and results visualization tools",
