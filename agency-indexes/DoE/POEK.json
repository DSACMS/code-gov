    "description": "POEK (Python Optimization Expression Kernel) is a Python library that supports the expression and manipulation of algebraic expressions commonly used in optimization applications. POEK interfaces with the COEK library to support fast methods for defining and managing expressions and performing automatic differentiation. POEK also interfaces with COEK to directly interface with optimization solvers (i.e. without relying on file I/O).
