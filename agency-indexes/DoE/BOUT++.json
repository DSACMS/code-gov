    "description": "The BOUT++ is a C++ framework for developing plasma fluid simulation codes, and has been developed by the University of York/UK and the LLNL Fusion Energy Program from the original 3D boundary turbulence 2-fluid edge simulation code BOUT. The aim of BOUT++ is to automate the common tasks needed for simulation codes, and to separate the complicated details such as differential geometry, parallel communication, and file input/output from the user-specified equations to be solved. The BOUT++ consists of BOUT++ library and physics modules. BOUT++ modules contains the coding for the specific set of physics equations and boundary conditions for particular physics problems using defined functions in BOUT++ library to perform standard differential operators.",
