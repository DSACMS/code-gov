    "description": "Mappymatch is a pure-python package developed and open sourced by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. It contains a collection of \"Matchers\" that enable matching a GPS trace (series of GPS coordinates) to a map.\n\nAs of 8/14/2023, The current matchers are:\n\nLCSSMatcher: A matcher that implements the LCSS algorithm described in this paper. Works best with high resolution GPS traces.\n\nOsrmMatcher: A light matcher that pings an OSRM server to request map matching results. See the official documentation for more info.\n\nValhallaMatcher: A matcher to ping a Valhalla server for map matching results.\nCurrently supported map formats are:\n\nOpen Street Maps\n\nNOTE: This software was formerly known as YAMM (Yet Another Map-Matcher)",
