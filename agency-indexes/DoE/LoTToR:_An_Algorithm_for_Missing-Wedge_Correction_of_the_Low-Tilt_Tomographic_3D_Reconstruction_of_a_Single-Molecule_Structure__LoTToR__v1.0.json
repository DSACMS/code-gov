    "description": "The low-tilt tomographic reconstruction (LoTToR) method is a post-processing method to correct the missing-wedge artifact, which contains a model-free iteration process under a set of constraints in real and reciprocal spaces. A proof of concept is conducted by using the LoTToR on a phantom, i.e., a simulated 3D reconstruction from a low-tilt series of images, including that within a tilt range of \u00b115\u00b0. The method is validated by using both negative-staining (NS) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) experimental data. A significantly reduced missing-wedge artifact verifies the capability of LoTToR, suggesting a new tool to support the future study of macromolecular dynamics, fluctuation and chemical activity from the viewpoint of single-molecule 3D structure determination. Moreover, the software can be used for hospital computer tomography (CT) to reduce the radiation damage to patients without reducing the CT image quality.",
