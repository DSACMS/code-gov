    "description": "The proposed framework derives a set of\nquality metrics to provide critical insights into and tracking of grid operations, sensor performance, sensor longevity, and\nevent statistics. Power grid engineers can utilize this information to identify problems with existing sensor locations and\nproblematic power grid assets including generators, transmission lines, load centers, and substations. This information\ncan also be used to identify unexpected/abnormal behavior of power grid components, improve power grid observability,\nand operational monitoring, and thus enhance real-time decision-making support system. Power grid planners can utilize\nthis information to augment existing sensing architecture with new sensors and improve the observability of the network.",
