    "description": "Mcqueuer is a simple tool that allows anyone from researchers to experienced developers to create multi-node/multi-core jobs by simply creating a file with a list of commands. Users simply combine tasks, which would otherwise each be their own job on the cluster, into a single file that is given to Mcqueuer. Mcqueuer then does the heavy lifting required to process the tasks in parallel in a single multi-node job. In addition, Mcqueuer provides load-balancing, which frees the user from having to worry about complex memory and CPU considerations, and instead focus on the processing itself.",
