    "description": "E3SM Kokkos Application Toolkit (EKAT) is a collection of C++, Fortran, and CMake utilities for providing a single implementation of common kernels based on the Kokkos programming model. The library contains utilities for vectorization, tridiagonal linear system solvers, and linear interpolation as well as some general-purpose utilities such as testing utilities, parameter lists, representation of physical units, and additional interfaces. The goal is to provide a centralized implementation for high-performance computing structures and common utilities that reduce code duplication and streamline maintenance efforts. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.
