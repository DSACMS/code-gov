    "description": "GPTune is an autotuning framework for exascale applications. Given an application with a set of parameters controlling its performance (e.g. runtime, memory and/or energy consumption, numerical accuracy, ...), GPTune aims at finding a combination of the parameters that yields the best possible performance. Although general enough, GPTune specializes in the tunning of expensive-to-run applications, where the cost of running the application is very expensive (in terms of computing power requirement and/or runtime).",
