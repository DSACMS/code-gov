    "description": "Acceptance and regression testing of a High Performance Computing (HPC) system requires an automated and reproducible framework and tool for running and logging results. Manually running tests across a system is labor intensive and prone to reproducibility errors. The OLCF Test Harness (OTH) provides a framework in which to document required tests for a HPC system. The OTH then provides tools to execute and log results of these tests in an automated fashion.",
