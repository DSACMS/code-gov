    "description": "LW3D is code for modeling beam dynamics in particle accelerators including Lienard-Wiechert self-fields. It is similar to codes like IMPACT-T except that the Poisson solver is replaced by a Lienard-Wiechert solver. Along with space-charge effects, the code can model effects like coherent synchrotron radiation.",
