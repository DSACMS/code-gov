    "description": "GraphLib is a support library used by other tools to create, manipulate, store, and export graphs. It provides a simple interface to specifS' arbitrary directed and undirected graphs by adding nodes and edges. Each node and edge can be associated with a set of attributes describing size, color, and shape. Once created, graphs can be manipulated using a set of graph analysis algorithms, including merge, prune, and path coloring operations. GraphLib also has the ability to export graphs into various open formats such as DOT and GML.",
