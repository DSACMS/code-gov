    "description": "PyGSTi is an implementation of Gate Set Tomography in the python programming language. Gate Set Tomography (GST) is a theory and protocol for simultaneously estimating the state preparation, gate operations, and measurement effects of a physical system of one or many quantum bits (qubits). These estimates are based entirely on the statistics of experimental measurements, and their interpretation and analysis can provide a detailed understanding of the types of errors/imperfections in the physical system. In this way, GST provides not only a means of certifying the \"goodness\" of qubits but also a means of debugging (i.e. improving) them.",
