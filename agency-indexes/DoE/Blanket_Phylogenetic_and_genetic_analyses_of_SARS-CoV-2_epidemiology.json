    "description": "I am submitting an umbrella/blanket disclosure because I am working on several inter-related projects in a fast-moving research area.  The general theme is statistical analysis and visualization of SARS-CoV-2 viral genetic sequence data in order to learn about epidemiology.  Examples of research questions are:  How do viral genetic relationships relate to contact tracing links?  How does viral genetics reflect signatures of transmission from one person to another?  Do some genetic variants have a consistent transmission advantage?",
