    "description": "Shifter enables application virtualization or containerization in large-scale HPC environments. This technology decreases the effort to port applications to or between HPC sites while increasing reproducibility and scientific productivity. Shifter works by converting application/container images to a common format, and then leverages basic Linux functionality to make that image available to batch jobs run in the HPC environment.",
