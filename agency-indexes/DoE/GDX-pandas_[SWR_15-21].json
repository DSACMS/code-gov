    "description": "This is a Python package to translate between gdx (GAMS data) and pandas. \n\nThere are two main ways to use gdxpds. The first use case is the one that was initially supported: direct conversion between GDX files on disk and pandas DataFrames or a csv version thereof. Starting with the Version 1.0.0 rewrite, there is now a second style of use which involves interfacing with GDX files and symbols via the `gdxpds.gdx.GdxFile` and `gdxpds.gdx.GdxSymbol` classes.\n\nPlease visit https://nrel.github.io/gdx-pandas for the latest documentation.",
