    "description": "This software contains numerical modules and application codes for studying the behavior of fluid dynamical systems where fluctuations play an important role in the dynamics. There is support for finite-volume/finite-difference solvers for partial differential equations, particle methods, and hybrid fluid-particle approaches.",
