    "description": "Jaqal-pup (Jaqal Programming Utilities Project) is a high-level Python metaprogramming interface for Jaqal, a quantum programming language for near-term quantum hardware (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09382 for a description of Jaqal). In addition to parsing and writing out Jaqal programs, it includes the ability to read in and write out quantum programs in other languages and frameworks, e.g. Qiskit (IBM), Quil (Rigetti), Cirq (Google), Q# (Microsoft), ProjectQ (ETH Zurich), and tket (Cambridge Quantum Computing). It implements a gate scheduler, an emulator of a small-scale quantum computer programmed using Jaqal, and tie-ins for other simulation back-ends.
