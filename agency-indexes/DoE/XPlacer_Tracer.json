    "description": "XPlacer/Tracer is a dynamic analysis tool that finds bad memory access patterns in heterogeneous codes. XPlacer/Tracer consists of two components. (1) A configurable ROSE plugin for source code instrumentation of heterogeneous code written in the C/C++ and CUDA programming languages. (2) A sample configuration that instruments memory accesses to dynamic memory in CPU and GPU codes, and a runtime library that tracks these memory accesses at runtime. The collected information is reported in form of a textual summary or as memory map that can be converted to images.",
