    "description": "CVLIB-D is a javascript framework to facilitate the creation of viewer applications for Spec-D Advanced Cinema Databases.\n\nBecause of the wide variety of data that Spec-D can represent, viewers for Spec-D databases often have to be custom-built for viewing a specific kind of data. This CVLIB-D is a not a viewer itself, but a library which handles the connection between Sources, Displays and Input/Output Structures as outlined in the databases JSON file to allow for the very easy creation of highly-customizable viewer applications.",
