    "description": "ExchCXX is a modern C++ library for the evaluation of exchange-correlation (XC) functionals required for density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In addition to providing high-level wrappers for the ubiquitous Libxc library for the CPU evaluation of XC functionals, ExchCXX also provides locally developed implementations of a small subset of XC functionals which may be evaluated either on the host (CPU) or device (GPU, FPGA, etc).",
