    "description": "TimeChart is a Python Qt-based graphing application for control systems. It is intended to be the modern, feature-by-feature matching alternative to the Motif EPICS Strip Tool application. Comparing with Strip Tool, TimeChart possesses the inherent cross-platform, responsive, and regularly maintained and supported advantages offered by Python Display Manager (PyDM). As a Python Qt-based framework, PyDM is also created and maintained by SLAC. Its charting capability is built upon pyqtgraph, and the PyDM's TimePlot is the central widget in TimeChart.",
