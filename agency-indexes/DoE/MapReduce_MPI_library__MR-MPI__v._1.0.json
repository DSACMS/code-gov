    "description": "The MapReduce MPI library is a software tool for performing MapReduce operations on a distributed memory parallel computer via message passing (MPI). These are data-processing or computational operations which achieve parallelism by breaking a large task into two stages, a map and a reduce . Each of these are formulated as simple on-processor functions which the user can easily write. The library assigns independent tasks to processors and performs the parallel data movement and transformations behind the scenes.",
