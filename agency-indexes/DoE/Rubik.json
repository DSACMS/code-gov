    "description": "Rubik is a tool that simplifies the process of creating task mappings for structured applications. Rubik allows an application developer to specify communicating groups of processes in a virtual application topology succinctly and map them onto groups of processors in a physical network topology. Both the application topology and the network topology must be Cartesian, but the dimensionality of either is arbitrary. This allows users to easily map low-dimensional structures such as planes to higher-dimensional structures like cubes to increase the number of links used for routing.",
