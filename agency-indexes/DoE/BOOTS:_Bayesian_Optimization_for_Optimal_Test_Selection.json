    "description": "BOOTS is a package for optimal selection of candidate operating points in large-scale manufacturing applications. It is designed to optimally select operating points to maximize predicted values of product quality and resource efficiency according to a data-driven model. The package is based on the use of a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) Gaussian process model to describe the relationships between inputs (operating points) and outputs (product quality and resource efficiency). This package does not provide any site- or process-specific information.",
