    "description": "Nyx is a highly parallel, adaptive mesh, finite-volume N-body compressible hydrodynamics solver for cosmological simulations. Nyx code solves equations of compressible hydrodynamics on an adaptive grid hierarchy coupled with an N-body treatment of dark matter. The gas dynamics in Nyx uses a finite volume methodology on a set of 3-D Eulerian grids; dark matter is represented as discrete particles moving under the influence of gravity. Particles are evolved via a particle-mesh method, using Cloud-in-Cell deposition/interpolation scheme. Both baryonic and dark matter contribute to the gravitational field. In addition, Nyx includes physics needed to accurately model the intergalactic medium: in optically thin limit and assuming ionization equilibrium, the code calculates heating and cooling processes of the primordial-composition gas in an ionizing ultraviolet background radiation field. Additional physics capabilities are under development.",
