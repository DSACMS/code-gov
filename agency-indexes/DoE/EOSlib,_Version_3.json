    "description": "Equilibrium thermodynamics underpins many of the technologies used throughout theoretical physics, yet verification of the various theoretical models in the open literature remains challenging. EOSlib provides a single, consistent, verifiable implementation of these models, in a single, easy-to-use software package. It consists of three parts: a software library implementing various published equation-of-state (EOS) models; a database of fitting parameters for various materials for these models; and a number of useful utility functions for simplifying thermodynamic calculations such as computing Hugoniot curves or Riemann problem solutions. Ready availability of this library will enable reliable code-to- code testing of equation-of-state implementations, as well as a starting point for more rigorous verification work. EOSlib also provides a single, consistent API for its analytic and tabular EOS models, which simplifies the process of comparing models for a particular application.",
