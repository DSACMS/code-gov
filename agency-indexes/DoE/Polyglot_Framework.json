    "description": "Polyglot utilizes a combination of custom and open source tools and libraries to provide developers with a consistent environment for building tools, etc. for a wide variety of targets with minimal changes to the code being built. It supports a variety of architectures and operating systems/firmware in as target-agnostic way as possible. This allows for developers to minimize the amount of time/effort required to port tools\u2014in particular, forensic tools\u2014to a wide variety of targets.\nThe project is comprised of two main components: a frontend toolchain that understands how to utilize other tools in order to build code for a specific target, and a minimalistic C library specific to Polyglot. These collectively provide the method to build code for a specific target, and the capability for code to interact with the underlying operating system when run on the target. Both components are written in a way to minimize the amount of target-specific knowledge required to both develop and utilize the project.",
