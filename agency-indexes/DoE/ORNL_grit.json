    "description": "Grit is a software library designed specifically for conducting particle-based Lagrangian simulations with CPU/GPUperformance portability. This library allows researchers and engineers to perform a wide range of simulations, including multiphase flow, and more. Grit employs Message Passing Interface (MPI) for distributed memory parallelism and Kokkos programming model for on-node shared memory parallelism with performance portability across different architectures of GPUs and multi-core/manycore CPUs.
