    "description": "Exawind-driver is a C++ code that is part of the ExaWind software stack.  It was designed to couple and drive hybrid-solver computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations where NREL's AMR-Wind (SWR-20-85) software and NREL's Nalu-Wind (SWR-20-27) CFD codes are run simultaneously and are two-way coupled via overset meshes and the TIOGA overset-mesh library.",
