    "description": "The Detection Framework Testbed and Toolkit \n(DFTT) is a signal detection system that uses\nautomatically generated subspace and correlation detectors. \n\nDFTT is intended to facilitate the development and testing of algorithms for operating suites of such detectors. \n\nThe software is a generalization of the system described in Harris and Dodge (2011) and has been applied in contexts ranging from local borehole induced seismicity to large-scale teleseismic observations. \n\nThe software includes interactive applications for creating detection configurations, inspecting and \nediting templates, viewing detection statistics, viewing detected signals, classifying detectors and more.",
