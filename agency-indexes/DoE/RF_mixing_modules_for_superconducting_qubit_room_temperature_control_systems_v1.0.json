    "description": "We have developed a series of compact RF mixing boards by integrating I/Q quadrature mixing, IF(intermediate frequency)/LO(local oscillator)/RF power level adjustments, and DC (direct current) bias fine tuning on a 40 mm \u00d7 80 mm 4-layer PCB (printed circuit board) board with EMI (electromagnetic interference) shielding.",
