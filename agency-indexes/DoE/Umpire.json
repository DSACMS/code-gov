    "description": "The Umpire library consists of a collection of software components that provide memory and resource management capabilities that can be used by diverse high performance computing (HPC) applications. The current set of capabilities that Umpire provides Includes: \n\u2022\tFlexible allocators to provision memory In the range of available memory resources on a target system.\n\u2022\tAn extensible allocation strategy model, allowing custom algorithms to be used to allocate memory resources in a scalable and high\u00adperformance fashion.\n\u2022\tMemory-location aware operations that can be used to migrate and modify memory using specialized functions dependent on source and target data locations\n\u2022\tA set of Introspection capabilities to allow the user to query the state of the different allocators and memory allocations.",
