    "description": "Isomorphic is a Ruby library for specifying isomorphisms between Ruby objects.\nThe inventive features of the new Ruby library are as follows:\nDomain-specific language (DSL) for declaration of isomorphisms between Ruby objects.\nFunctional references (viz., \"lenses\") for getter/setter operations.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first library of its kind for the Ruby programming language. Moreover, to our knowledge, this is the first implementation of the \"functional references\" concept within the Ruby programming language.",
