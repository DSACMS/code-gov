    "description": "Compilers transform program source code to machine executable code. During this transformation, they perform a number of compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the generated executable\ncode. Importantly, applying those optimizations depends on the source code structure, such as the parallel programming model used to\nparallelize an algorithm. Often, implementations of the same algorithm with different programming models have vastly different performance because the compiler optimized them differently. We create FAROS, a framework to structure and automate the analysis of compiler optimizations on programs. FAROS automates the building process, execution profiling, and analysis of compiler optimization of programs, through a configuration interface. It outputs compiler optimization reports to show which\noptimizations applied to which line of source code, leveraging compilation remarks output by the compiler. Also, FAROS supports\nbenchmarking performance of different program versions by collecting execution time results. In this first release of FAROS, we provide a configuration file to analyze compiler optimization differences for sequential vs OpenMP compilation, including 38 programs consisting of HPC proxy/mini/large applications, and NAS and Rodina kernels for analysis.
