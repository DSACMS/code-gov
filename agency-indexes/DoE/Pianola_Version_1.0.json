    "description": "Pianola is a software benchmark for measuring the performance of input/output (I/O) hardware and software. It works by monitoring the I/O activity of an existing application and storing the sequence of events, along with their timing, in a script. After some additional processing, a separate piece of software in this package can replay these I/) events and replicate their timing without reference to the original application. Therefore, Pianola allows users to create standalone I/O benchmarks that mimic the behavior of applications that either cannot be released or that are difficult for nonspecialists to configure, build or run.",
