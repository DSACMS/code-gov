    "description": "VPIC is a general-purpose Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulation code for modeling multi-species kinetic plasmas in one, two, or three spatial dimensions. VPIC can solve equations of motion for different plasma species using kinetic or fluid descriptions. To solve for the kinetic species, VPIC employs a variety of explicit and implicit time-stepping schemes to update charged particle positions and velocities. In contrast, the fluid species is advanced in time by solving a number of fluid moment equations on a spatial grid using finite-difference methods. The electromagnetic fields are also solved on a spatial grid using either the full Maxwell equations, or a low frequency quasi-neutral approximation that uses an Ohm's law for the electric field. To couple the kinetic particle quantities with the grid-based field and fluid-moment descriptions requires that electromagnetic fields are interpolated from spatial grid points to the particle positions, and current densities are collected from the particles onto the spatial grid points. The VPIC code has been optimized for modern computing architectures and uses Message Passing Interface (MPI) calls for multi-node execution, in addition to exploiting node-level data-parallelism. The current feature set for VPIC includes a flexible input deck format capable of treating a wide variety of problems. These include: the ability to treat electromagnetic materials (scalar and tensor dielectric, conductivity, and diamagnetic material properties); multiple emission models, including user-configurable models; arbitrary, user-configurable boundary conditions for particles and fields; user-definable simulation units; a suite of \"standard\" diagnostics, as well as user-configurable diagnostics; a Monte-Carlo treatment of collisional processes capable of treating binary and unary collisions and secondary particle generation; and, flexible checkpoint-restart semantics enabling VPIC checkpoint files to be read as input for subsequent simulations. While the common use cases for VPIC employ low-order particles on rectilinear meshes, a framework exists to treat higher-order particles and curvilinear meshes, as well as more advanced field solvers.",
