    "description": "The MTINV toolkit (2002-present) is a collection of computer codes and applications written to invert for\nthe moment tensor of a seismic source given the three components of ground motion recorded at regional\nseismic stations (e.g., Ichinose et al., 2003). The computer codes and workflow are organized to\ngenerate moment tensor solutions for a range of source depths and origin times because of the trade-off\nbetween these two quantities. The metric used is the variance reduction and variance reduction\nmodulated by the percent double-couple to determine the best-fit moment-tensor solution. We can solve\nfor a deviatoric moment tensor with a constraint added for no isotropic component although this constraint\ncan be lifted for estimating the full moment tensor like mining collapses or explosion sources.",
