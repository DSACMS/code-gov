    "description": "SAND2021-7300 O The Rattlesnake Vibration Controller is a combined-environments, multiple input/multiple output control system for dynamic excitation of structures under test. It provides capabilities to control multiple responses on the part using multiple exciters and control strategies. Rattlesnake is written in the Python programming language to facilitate multiple input/multiple output vibration research by allowing users to prescribe custom control laws to the controller. Rattlesnake can target multiple hardware devices, or even perform synthetic control to simulate a test virtually. Rattlesnake has been used to execute control problems with up to 200 response channels and 12 drives. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
