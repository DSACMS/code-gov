    "description": "The Graph-Env library provides a framework for adapting graph search problems into OpenAI Gym environments for reinforcement learning. In other words, Graph-Env enables reinforcement learning algorithms to be applied to graph search problems. Graph search problems include molecule and crystal structure design problems; route planning problems, including traveling salesperson problem; puzzles and games, such as chess and go; shortest path problems; minimum spanning tree; vehicle path generation; and others.",
