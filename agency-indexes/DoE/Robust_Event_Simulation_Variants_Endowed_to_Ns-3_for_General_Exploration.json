    "description": "Sandia's ns-3 contributions are modifications to the open source ns-3 network simulator that enable simulation speedup.  One improvement, for example, removes the need for simulating the transmission and receipt of packets between nodes that are too distant to actually be able to communicate.  In large-scale simulations this optimization has shown significant gains in performance.  Additional contributions will pave the way for parallel discrete simulation (PDES) in ns-3.
