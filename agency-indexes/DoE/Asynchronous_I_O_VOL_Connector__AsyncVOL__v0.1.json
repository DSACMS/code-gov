    "description": "Asynchronous I/O is becoming increasingly popular with the large amount of data access required by scientific applications. They can take advantage of an asynchronous interface by scheduling I/O as early as possible and overlap computation or communication with I/O operations, which hides the cost associated with I/O and improves the overall performance.",
