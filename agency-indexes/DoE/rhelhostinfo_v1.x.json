    "description": "rhelhostinfo v1.x adds some functionality to the existing approved C21099 rhelhostinfo by identifying host configuration changes over time. It provides a framework that allows organizations to modify the application functionality for their own requirements, including the ability to configure or return a host to DoD STIG standards per the open-source openSCAP project using the XCCDF framework, identify user command-line history, enumerate the local OSI layer 3 environment, identify and assist with configuring the host firewall, conduct limited packet capture and identify relevant network information.",
