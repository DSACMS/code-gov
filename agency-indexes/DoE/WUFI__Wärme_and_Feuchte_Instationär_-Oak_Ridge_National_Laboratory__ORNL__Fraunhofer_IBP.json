    "description": "WUFI - Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)/Fraunhofer IBP is a menu-driven PC program which allows realistic calculation of the transient coupled one-dimensional heat and moisture transport in multi-layer building components exposed to natural weather. It is based on the newest findings regarding vapor diffusion and liquid transport in building materials and has been validated by detailed comparison with measurements obtained in the laboratory and on outdoor testing fields. Together with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Fraunhofer IBP has developed a special version of WUFI \u00ae for North America. WUFI\u00ae ORNL is a functionally limited free version of WUFI\u00ae Pro for non-commercial purposes. It contains climate data for 62 cities in the USA and Canada which are all available in the free version.",
