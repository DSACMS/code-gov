    "description": "ROSSTEP is a system for sequentially running roslaunch, rosnode, and bash scripts automatically, for use in Robot Operating System (ROS) applications. The system consists of YAML files which define actions and conditions. A python file parses the code and runs actions sequentially using the sys and subprocess python modules. Between actions, it uses various ROS-based code to check conditions required to proceed, and only moves on to the next action when all the necessary conditions have been met. Included is rosstep-creator, a QT application designed to create the YAML files required for ROSSTEP. It has a nearly one-to-one mapping from interface elements to YAML output, and serves as a convenient GUI for working with the ROSSTEP system.",
