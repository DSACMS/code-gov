    "description": "TestSNAP is a stand-alone prototype of the SNAP force kernel used in the LAMMPS molecular dynamics code.  It contains synthetic input data (neighbor atom positions) and reference output data (forces on atoms) for several different SNAP models.  The prototype performs the force calculation repeatedly, checking the results against the reference data. At the end it reports the grind time [msec/atomstep] and RMS force error [eV/A].  This allows performance experts to quickly test new hardware and software strategies, obtain a realistic performance estimate and verify that the computation was performed correctly.
