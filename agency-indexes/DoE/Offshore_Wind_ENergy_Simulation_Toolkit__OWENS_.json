    "description": "SAND2021-2751 O\nThe Offshore Wind ENergy Simulation Toolkit (OWENS) is a collection of aerodynamic, structural, hydrodynamic, drivetrain, controls, composite structure and mesh preprocessing, and data postprocessing. OWENS is primarily an ontology, or glue code, pulling together many open-source and Sandia-developed libraries to model the aero-servo-hydro-elastic physics of wind and marine energy turbines. The toolkit\u2019s intended use is for arbitrary aeroelastic rotor configurations analysis including vertical-axis wind turbines, horizontal-axis wind turbines, and analogous marine energy applications for fixed-bottom and floating configurations. Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525",
