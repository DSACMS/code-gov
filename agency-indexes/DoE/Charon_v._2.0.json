    "description": "Charon is used to solve the drift-diffusion PDE Equations associated with semi-conductor physics. it is used to stimulate the operation of semi-conductor devices such as transistors and diodes. Additionally, the ode includes the functionality, but no the restricted data, to model these devices under the effects of neutron radiation.",
