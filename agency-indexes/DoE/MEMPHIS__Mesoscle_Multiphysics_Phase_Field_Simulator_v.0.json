    "description": "SAND2024-01427O\nMesoscale Multiphysics Phase Field Simulator (MEMPHIS) is used for solving interfacial problems and can be applied to many evolutionary problems. Some examples are solidification dynamics, viscous fingering, fracture mechanics, hydrogen embrittlement, vesicle dynamics, electro-mechanical degradation of batteries, aging of microstructures, and segregation. MEMPHIS is written in Fortran 90 in a modular fashion, where model and numerical solvers are decoupled from one another. \nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
