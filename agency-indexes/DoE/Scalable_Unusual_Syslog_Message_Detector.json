    "description": "The Scalable Unusual Message Detector (SUD) is a scalable software program for finding anomalous log messages on a single machine or cluster in near real time. This program is able to detect unusual messages by turning the text into sets of ngrams, which are multiple sets of tokens/words per message, and comparing incoming messages with the saved ngrams. A set of rules are used for determining if the saved ngrams match an incoming message based on the size of the incoming message. This tools is intended to final unusual/anomalous messages to find critical events that system administrators are not expecting. Currently the algorithms/methods are being used on HPC\u2019s scalalble log analysis machine. Work is being done to port the algorithms/methods to a standalone tool.",
