    "description": "The Whole Building Energy Diagnostician v. 3.x software detects anomalies in energy consumption of buildings and major building systems using metered energy-use data and measured values of driving variables (e.g., outdoor-air temperature, outdoor-air relative humidity, and building occupancy schedule). The software then provides alarms for anomalous consumption and information on energy and cost impacts. This version is intended to be implemented as a world wide web application and made accessible to end users by use of a Web browser and an Internet connection, but the web interface is not provided as part of the software - a web service provider must provide the web-based graphical user interface.",
