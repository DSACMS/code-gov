    "description": "Benchmark Algorithm for Radio-Nuclide Identification (BARNI) is an automatic radionuclide identification\ntool for use with gamma-ray spectra. BARNI is designed to serve as a comparative tool for commercial\nvendor algorithms, such as those found in RadioIsotope Identification Devices (RIID). The tool\nincorporates an automated training routine allowing BARNI's classifier to be trained for a variety of\ndetectors. The identification algorithm uses a peak search, the results of which are used to build features\nthat are subsequently used for training a classifier. The user provided spectral templates allow BARNI to\nbe trained for any detector of the user's choice.\nIs",
