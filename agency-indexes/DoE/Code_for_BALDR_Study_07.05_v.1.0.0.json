    "description": "SAND2024-01293O\nThe Code for BALDR Study 07.05 software reproduces results from the BALDR study concerning \"A Semi-Supervised Learning Method to Produce Explainable Radioisotope Proportion Estimates for NaI-based Synthetic and Measured Gamma Spectra.\" \n\nThe code for BALDR Study 07.05 can reproduce a scientific study following the step numbers within the file names. Using synthetic and measured data to find the best model for the radioisotope proportion estimation task of interest, the study generated results for inclusion in a paper. The high-level methods involved are neural networks, semi-supervised learning, and out-of-distribution detection. \nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
