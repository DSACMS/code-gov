    "description": "To reduce hand/wrist pain from frequent computer use I decided to create a program that will convert voice to common keyboard/mouse actions in order to reduce clicks/keypresses. It is not intended to replace the keyboard and mouse, but rather to reduce their use, hence the name Sidekick. Sidekick handles transcription, mouse movement/click/wheel, and common commands.\n",
