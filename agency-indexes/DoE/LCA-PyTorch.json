    "description": "LCA-PyTorch is a code repository which contains PyTorch implementations of the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA), which is a biologically-plausible sparse coding model. LCA-PyTorch allows for the training, testing, and analysis of single layer LCA networks, multi-layer LCA networks, and hybrid LCA-based deep neural network models on a wide variety of applications and data types. LCA-PyTorch was developed in Python, a high-level programming language that takes advantage of the Python ecosystem of high-quality open-source packages for machine learning. LCA-PyTorch interfaces heavily with the open-source PyTorch Python package.   ",
