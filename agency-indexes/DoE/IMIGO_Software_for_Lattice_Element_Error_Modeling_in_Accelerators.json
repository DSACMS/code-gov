    "description": "This nonlinear program was developed from a nonlinear solver (called OASIS).   During Phase I work, it was applied on a number of nonlinear-solver benchmarking problems and a few SLAC accelerator problems.  By searching over only two optimization-control parameters, this Phase I work has enabled the development of a systematic procedure to facilitate the finding of a \"best-guessed\" global minimum solution for various types of problems with different size and complexity.   This set of rules has been codified and has led to a versatile nonlinear program IMIGO.",
