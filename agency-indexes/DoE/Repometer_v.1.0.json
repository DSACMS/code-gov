    "description": "SAND2022-4256 O\nOnline version control platforms offer insight into traffic and engagement with source code repositories, but only in limited ways and over short windows of time. Scientific software teams at Sandia National Laboratories and elsewhere want to collect and store engagement data to help tell their story and the impact their work has on the community. Repometer aims to supplement existing capabilities by collecting timely and insightful data from GitHub and GitLab repositories and passing it to a database for longer-term storage.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",
