    "description": "Spatial Modeling for Resources Framework (SMRF) was developed by Dr. Scott Havens at the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) in Boise, ID. SMRF was designed to increase the flexibility of taking measured weather data and distributing the point measurements across a watershed. SMRF was developed to be used as an operational or research framework, where ease of use, efficiency, and ability to run in near real time are high priorities.",
