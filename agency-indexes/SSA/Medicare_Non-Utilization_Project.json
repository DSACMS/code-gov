    "description": "The Medicare Non-Usage Project (MNUP) objective is to use Medicare non-utilization information furnished to us by CMS as an indicator to select and prioritize cases for review to determine continued eligibility to SSA Title II benefits.  We will obtain an initial data extract of individuals age 90 or over who are living in the United States, in current pay status and have not used Medicare during the previous three years.  Subsequent data extracts will be obtained bi-annually.  The data received from CMS will include Title II beneficiaries who reside in  nursing homes, are enrolled in HMOs, or have private health insurance.",
