    "description": "Performance management data extracted from multiple sources is consolidated into the QPMS data warehouse, providing a \"one-stop\" source for generating quality performance measures.  The Disability Adjudication Review Evaluation System (DARES) provides a dashboard display of necessary management/decision support and risk information to Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (ODAR) officials, allowing them to effectively monitor and control the hearings backlog reduction initiatives and to determine the health of the overall hearings backlog reduction program at SSA. DARES also serves as the front-end starting point for QPMS DARES, which offers web-based, parameter-driven reports that are based on the breakdown of ODAR workloads within the context of how they relate to key hearing backlog initiatives.\u00c2 ",
