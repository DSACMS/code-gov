    "description": "Dual score card application based on the Predictive Model design architecture written by IBM. It is called when initial adjudicative disability cases are transferred to the DDS for a medical determination. It will analyze the date electronically and produce two values, each between 0 and 1. The first value will express the confidence that a favorable determination will be made (known as SSAL - SSA Allowance). The second (known as SSPT - SSA Processing Time) will express the confidence that the determination can be reached quickly.",
