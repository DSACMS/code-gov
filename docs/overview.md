2. Federal Open Source Policy Compliance 
    
    The site encourages developers that develop code for the Federal government to abide by Federal policy regarding source code. Key policy in this regard includes [OMB Memorandum M-16-21](https://www.opm.gov/about-us/open-government/digital-government-strategy/fitara/memorandum-for-open-source-software-policy/) as well as the [SHARE IT Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/9566).

4. Encouraging Public Contributions

    The site allows developers, businesses and citizens to view and assist with open issues and problems present on Federal open source projects. 

5. Supports Innovation

    Facilitates collaboration between government agencies and the tech community to improve public services.
