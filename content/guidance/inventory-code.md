# Overview

Section
  <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf" target="_blank">7.2</a>
  and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf" target="_blank">7.3</a> of the Source Code Policy require agencies to provide an inventory of their 'custom-developed code' to support government-wide reuse and make Federal open source code easier to find.

Using these inventories, <!--TODO: Fix this URL to be Code.gov after new CNAME is pointed--><a href="https://dsacms.github.io/code-gov/">Code.gov</a> will provide a platform to search federally funded open source software and software available for government-wide reuse.

## Publishing Your Agency's Inventory

Agencies are required to publish their inventories using a standard metadata schema - a JSON file that they'll make available on their agency websites. Agencies are strongly encouraged to use version 2.0.0 of the schema, which is described below. This version includes revisions that make your inventory much more useful and intuitive.

Agencies should make the `code.json` available in the root folder of their website (e.g., https://www.agency.gov/code.json). Code.gov will then retrieve these JSON files daily and compile them.

## Metadata Schema version 2.0.0

The schema fields and definitions are listed below.
Here is <a href="https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-data/blob/master/schemas/schema-2.0.0.json">version 2.0.0 of the metadata schema file in JSON format</a>
with parent/child relationships.

### Agency code.json file location and contents:
<ul>
  <li><code>code.json</code> must live in the root directory of your agencyâ€™s website.</li>
  <li>
    <code>code.json</code> must include a single object represented as JSON, with key-value pairs according to the list below.
  </li>
</ul>

## Source Code Considerations for AI R&amp;D Models
Consistent with the 
<a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2025/01/14/executive-order-on-advancing-united-states-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence-infrastructure/">Executive Order on Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence (EO 13859)</a>, agencies are directed to improve source code inventory documentation (i.e., agency code.json) to enable discovery and usability of source code AI models.

## Example code.json file

Here are some [good metadata examples](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov/blob/master/docs/metadata_examples.md) for reference when creating your agency code.json file.

You can find previous schema revisions in [our changelog](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-data/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
