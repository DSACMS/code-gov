Agencies are required to perform various tasks in order to satisfy the objectives of the Federal Source Code Policy. Currently, agencies are evaluated on whether they've completed three tasks:

1. **Updated Agency Policy**: Agencies must update their policies to be consistent with the Federal Source Code Policy.
2. **Updated Acquisition Language**: Agencies must update acquisition language to capture new custom code whether built by a contractor or federal employee.
3. **Updated Code Inventory**: Agencies must create and update an agency source code inventory to be placed online on agency website and Code.gov.

Agencies are evaluated as fully compliant (green), partially compliant (yellow), or non-compliant (red) with the tasks outlined above. An agency's overall compliance is green only if they are green in all categories. This is an assessment of agency compliance over the course of the pilot program.
